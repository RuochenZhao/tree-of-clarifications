It was the first time in National Basketball Association (NBA) history that two reigning All-NBA Team players were traded for each other midseason. It is considered one of the most unexpected and lopsided trades in NBA history, even though the Mavericks still received an All-NBA player, as Don\u010di\u0107 is perceived as a generational player and is several years younger.\\nAt the time of the trade, Don\u010di\u0107, who led the Mavericks to the 2024 NBA Finals and had made five consecutive All-NBA First Teams and All-Star appearances (every year other than his rookie season), had established himself as the cornerstone of the franchise. The popular perception was that the Mavericks would never trade him, with Don\u010di\u0107 himself stating that he wanted to spend his entire career in Dallas. The Mavericks stated that they traded Don\u010di\u0107 to improve the team's defense, and the Mavericks also had concerns about his behaviour, work ethic and conditioning, as he reportedly weighed as much as 270 pounds (120 kg). Their belief that Don\u010di\u0107 would be able to improve his fitness was proven when Don\u010di\u0107 underwent a physical transformation after the Lakers' playoff exit, appearing in a Men's Health Magazine article.\\nJournalists have called the transaction one of the most unexpected trades in NBA and American sports history, with many media members, fans and NBA players criticizing it and expressing shock as Don\u010di\u0107 had not even requested a trade and was an All-NBA player in his prime. The overwhelming consensus was that the Lakers won the trade.  Mavericks fans reacted negatively to the trade and protested it after the announcement, with many calling for the firing of general manager Nico Harrison. The trade received revived scrutiny when the Mavericks won the first overall pick (used to select Cooper Flagg) in the 2025 NBA draft lottery, with accusations of it being rigged and meant as a compensation for the lopsided trade.\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"How many times have the lakers won the finals?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": \"DQ 1: How many NBA championships have the Los Angeles Lakers won in their history?\\nDA 1: 17\\nDQ 2: How many Western Conference titles have the Los Angeles Lakers won?\\nDA 2: 19\\nDQ 3: How many NBA Finals appearances have the Los Angeles Lakers made?\\nDA 3: 32\",\n  \"Answer\": \"The Los Angeles Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the NBA, and the question of how many times they have won the finals can refer to different achievements.

The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under the authority of the United States, constitute the \\\"supreme Law of the Land\\\", and thus take priority over any conflicting state laws. It provides that state courts are bound by, and state constitutions subordinate to, the supreme law. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (part of the Bill of Rights) provides that \\\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \\\" The Guarantee Clause of Article 4 of the Constitution states that \\\"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government. \\\" These two provisions indicate states did not surrender their wide latitude to adopt a constitution, the fundamental documents of state law, when the U. S. Constitution was adopted. State constitutions are much longer than the United States Constitution, which only contains 4,543 words. State constitutions are all longer than 8,000 words because they are more detailed regarding the day-to-day relationships between government and the people. The shortest is the Constitution of Vermont, adopted in 1793 and currently 8,295 words long. The longest was Alabama's sixth constitution, ratified in 1901, about 345,000 words long, but rewritten in 2022. Both the federal and state constitutions are organic texts: they are the fundamental blueprints for the legal and political organizations of the United States and the states, respectively. Typically state constitutions address a wide array of issues deemed by the states to be of sufficient importance to be included in the constitution rather than in an ordinary statute. Often modeled after the federal Constitution, they outline the structure of the state government and typically establish a bill of rights, an executive branch headed by a governor (and often one or more other officials, such as a lieutenant governor and state attorney general), a state legislature, and state courts, including a state supreme court (a few states have two high courts, one for civil cases, the other for criminal cases). They also provide general governmental framework for what each branch is supposed to do and how it should go about doing it. Additionally, many other provisions may be included. Many state constitutions, unlike the federal constitution, also begin with an invocation of God. Some states allow amendments to the constitution by initiative. Many states have had several constitutions over the course of their history. The territories of the United States are \\\"organized\\\" and, thus, self-governing if the United States Congress has passed an Organic Act. Two of the 14 territories without commonwealth status \u2014 Guam and the United States Virgin Islands \u2014 are organized, but have not adopted their own constitutions.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abSex education in India , sometimes viewed as a taboo topic; across the country and within the community, opinions on how or whether to deliver it are divided. The states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have banned or refused to implement sex education in schools. The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh said sex education had \\\"no place in Indian culture\\\" and plans to introduce yoga in schools instead. On the global level, India has notably fallen behind numerous countries, including underdeveloped and significantly smaller countries such as Sudan and the Congo Republic, where sex education is first taught at the primary level.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abQuit India Movement , during World War II, demanding an end to British rule in India. After Britain failed to secure Indian support for the British war effort with the Cripps Mission, Gandhi made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. Viceroy Linlithgow described the movement as \\\"by far the most serious rebellion since 1857\\\".\\nThe All India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called \\\"An Orderly British Withdrawal\\\" from India. Even though it was at war, Britain was prepared to act. Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi's speech. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy's Council, of the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement. The major outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands.\\nThe movement included anti-British boycotts and rejection of transactions involving the colonial government. Various violent incidents took place around the country against British rule, and the colonial government arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the issue for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully. The movement ended in 1945 with the release of all jailed nationalists. Prominent independence activists who died during the movement included Mukunda Kakati, Matangini Hazra, Kanaklata Barua, Kushal Konwar, Bhogeswari Phukanani and others. In 1992, the Reserve Bank of India issued a 1 rupee commemorative coin to mark the Golden Jubilee of the Quit India Movement.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abIndian National Congress , colloquially the Congress Party, or simply the Congress, is a big tent political party in India. It is one of the two major Indian political parties alongside the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the oldest party in India. Founded on 28 December 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement. The Congress was one of the parties who led India to independence from the United Kingdom, and significantly influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire. The INC is a \\\"big tent\\\" party that has been described as sitting on the centre of the Indian political spectrum. The party held its first session in 1885 in Bombay where W. C. Bonnerjee presided over it. After Indian independence in 1947, Congress emerged as a catch-all, Indian nationalist and secular party, dominating Indian politics for the next 50 years. The party's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, led the Congress to support socialist policies by creating the Planning Commission, introducing Five-Year Plans, implementing a mixed economy, and establishing a secular state. After Nehru's death and the short tenure of Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi became the leader of the party. In the 17 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on seven occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further three times, heading the central government for more than 54 years. There have been six prime ministers from the Congress party, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947\u20131964), and the most recent being Manmohan Singh (2004\u20132014). Since the 1990s, the Bharatiya Janata Party has emerged as the main rival of the Congress in both national and regional politics. In 1969, the party suffered a major split, with a faction led by Indira Gandhi leaving to form the Congress (R), with the remainder becoming the Congress (O). The Congress (R) became the dominant faction, winning the 1971 general election by a huge margin. From 1975 to 1977, Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India, resulting in widespread oppression and abuses of power. Another split in the party occurred in 1979, leading to the creation of the Congress (I), which was recognised as the Congress by the Election Commission in 1981. Under Rajiv Gandhi's leadership, the party won a massive victory in the 1984 general elections, nevertheless losing the election held in 1989 to the National Front. The Congress then returned to power under P. V. Narasimha Rao, who moved the party towards an economically liberal agenda, a sharp break from previous leaders. However, it lost the 1996 general election and was replaced in government by the National Front.\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"How many states in india are under congress?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": {\n    \"DQ 1\": \"How many states in India currently have a government led by the Indian National Congress?\",\n    \"DA 1\": \"Current information is needed\"\n  },\n  \"Answer\": \"The question of how many states in India are under Congress is ambiguous because it could refer to the current number of states governed by the Indian National Congress, the maximum number of states historically governed by the party, or whether the party leads a single-party government or a coalition.

Missionaries invited by Moshoeshoe I developed orthography and printed works in the Sesotho language between 1837 and 1855. The country set up diplomatic channels and acquired guns for use against the encroaching Europeans and the Korana people. Territorial conflicts with both British and Boer settlers arose periodically, including Moshoeshoe's notable victory over the Boers in the Free State\u2013Basotho War, but the final war in 1867 with an appeal to Queen Victoria, who agreed to make Basutoland a British suzerainty. In 1869, the British signed a treaty at Aliwal with the Boers that defined the boundaries of Basotholand and later Lesotho, which by ceding the western territories effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size.\\nThe extent to which the British exerted direct control over Basotholand waxed and waned until Basotholand\u2019s independence in 1966 when it became the Kingdom of Lesotho. However, when the ruling Basotho National Party (BNP) lost the first post-independence general elections to the Basotho Congress Party (BCP), Leabua Jonathan refused to cede and declared himself Tona Kholo (Sesotho translation of prime minister). The BCP began an insurrection that culminated in a January 1986 military coup, that then forced the BNP out of office. Power was transferred to King Moshoeshoe II, until then a ceremonial monarch, but forced into exile when he lost favor with the military the following year. His son was installed as King Letsie III.

This was only achieved after defeating the Zulu Kingdom, at the Battle of Blood River, which took place on Sunday 16 December 1838. This battle would not have taken place if the Zulu King had honoured the agreement that he had made with the Voortrekkers to live together peacefully. The Zulu king knew that they outnumbered the Voortrekkers and decided to overthrow them and that led to the Battle of Blood River.\\nIn January 1840 Prince Mpande finally defeated King Dingane in the Battle of Maqongqe and was subsequently crowned as new king of the Zulu by his alliance partner Andries Pretorius.

On multiple occasions, proposals have arisen to make the post permanent, but without result. The same goes for the post of deputy prime minister at the national level.\\nThe first deputy chief minister of Telangana was Mahmood Ali, who was also Minister of Revenue, Relief & Rehabilitation, ULC, Stamps & Registration in Chandrashekar Rao's first ministry. The second deputy chief minister was T. Rajaiah, who took on the role in addition to his health ministership in K. Chandrashekar Rao's government. On 25 January 2015, the chief minister K.

The institution of chattel slavery was established in North America in the 16th century under Spanish, British, French, and Dutch colonization.\\nAfter the United States was founded in 1776, the country split into slave states (states permitting slavery) and free states (states prohibiting slavery). Slavery became concentrated in the Southern United States. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves banned the Atlantic slave trade starting in 1808, but not the domestic slave trade or slavery itself. Slavery was finally ended throughout the entire country after the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), in which the U.S. government defeated a confederation of rebelling slave states that attempted to secede from the U.S. During the war, U.S. president Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which ordered the liberation of all slaves in rebelling states. In December 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, abolishing chattel slavery nationwide. Native American slave ownership also persisted until 1866, when the federal government negotiated new treaties with the \\\"Five Civilized Tribes\\\" in which they agreed to end slavery. Some argue slavery continues to exist in other forms by the clauses of the 13th amendment.\\nIn June 2021, Juneteenth, a day that commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., became a federal holiday.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00ab{'snippet': 'The Thirteenth Amendment (proposed in 1864 and ratified in 1865) abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except for those duly convicted of a crime.

Additional usage notes are provided when useful.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abSpeech repetition , it is the saying by one individual of the spoken vocalizations made by another individual. Speech repetition requires the person repeating the utterance to have the ability to map the sounds that they hear from the other person's oral pronunciation to similar places and manners of articulation in their own vocal tract.\\nSuch speech imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in speech shadowing in which people automatically say words heard in earphones, and the pathological condition of echolalia in which people reflexively repeat overheard words. That links to speech repetition of words being separate in the brain to speech perception. Speech repetition occurs in the dorsal speech processing stream, and speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by that route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay after the storage in phonological memory.\\nIn humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed because of the copying ability playing a critical role in children's rapid expansion of their spoken vocabulary. In older children and adults, that ability remains important, as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and additional languages. That repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary transmissions because  children prefer to copy words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[3] \u00ab{'snippet': 'In rhetoric, parallel syntax is a rhetorical device that consists of repetition among adjacent sentences or clauses. The repeated sentences or clauses provide emphasis to a central theme or idea the author is trying to convey.

The repeated sentences or clauses provide emphasis to a central theme or idea the author is trying to convey. Parallelism is the mark of a mature language speaker.\\nIn language, syntax is the structure of a sentence, thus parallel syntax can also be called parallel sentence structure. This rhetorical tool improves the flow of a sentence as it adds a figure of balance to sentences it is implemented into. It also aids in making the sentence more concise by eliminating unnecessary words that could distract the reader from the main idea and following a clear pattern of language. It is a simple way to achieve clarity and avoid ambiguity, but it is avoided unless the relationship of the ideas or details they express justifies parallelism. Parallel structure is like the derived conjunction analysis because it assumes several underlying complete sentences.\\nIn addition to providing emphasis, it is evident that parallel structure appeals to the reader or listener in a variety of ways as well.  Primarily, the repetition of clauses promotes a heightened mental ability to process the sentence as a whole; studies have shown that the reiteration of the second clause will increase the speed an individual can process the sentence.  Furthermore, it decreases the load of information needed to be processed by the reader, facilitating comprehension. Because it is more appealing, it is also more persuasive.  \\nAccording to Aristotle, persuasion is created through parallel syntax by means of repetition.  Recapping crucial aspects of an argument through properly created phrases and clauses further embeds the idea into the listener, ultimately resulting in persuasion.  However, these clauses must be created precisely, in a way similar to poetry, in order to maximize the effect.  For example, paired sentences, phrases, or clauses must be created with equal structure in regards to verb and noun choice, along with both number of syllables and meter; according to Aristotle, the more ways in which these aspects match, the more persuasive the argument will be. Faulty parallelism most often occurs with coordinating conjunctions that connect nouns and adjectives.\\nUsing parallel syntax among two clauses is known as an isocolon, when among three clauses it is known as a tricolon.  Having similar syntactical structure among clauses or phrases helps the reader identify the similarity of ideas proposed within them. Isocolon is made up of the Greek words iso (equal) and kolon (member), so each part or clause is the same length. A tricolon has 3 clauses that do not need to be the same length. An isocolon can be a tricolon but a tricolon cannot be an isocolon.\\nParallel syntax is often used in conjunction with antithesis, anaphora, asyndeton, climax, epistrophe and symploce.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00ab{'snippet': 'In grammar, parallelism, also known as parallel structure or parallel construction, is a balance within one or more sentences of similar phrases or clauses that have the same grammatical structure.
