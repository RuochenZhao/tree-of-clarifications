            "Mobile phone | A mobile phone or cell phone is a portable wireless  telephone that allows users to make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while moving within a designated telephone service area, unlike fixed-location phones (landline phones). This radio frequency link connects to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, providing access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephony relies on a cellular network architecture, which is why mobile phones are often referred to as 'cell phones' in North America.\nBeyond traditional voice communication, digital mobile phones have evolved to support a wide range of additional services. These include text messaging, multimedia messaging, email, and internet access (via LTE, 5G NR or Wi-Fi), as well as short-range wireless technologies like Bluetooth, infrared, and ultra-wideband (UWB).\nMobile phones also support a variety of multimedia capabilities, such as digital photography, video recording, and gaming. In addition, they enable multimedia playback and streaming, including video content, as well as radio and television streaming. Furthermore, mobile phones offer satellite-based services, such as navigation and messaging, as well as business applications and payment solutions (via scanning QR codes or near-field communication (NFC)). Mobile phones offering only basic features are often referred to as feature phones (slang: dumbphones), while those with advanced computing power are known as smartphones.\nThe first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by Martin Cooper of Motorola in New York City on 3 April 1973, using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs). In 1979, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan. In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone. From 1993 to 2024, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over 9.1 billion; enough to provide one for every person on Earth. In 2024, the top smartphone manufacturers worldwide were Samsung, Apple and Xiaomi; smartphone sales represented about 50 percent of total mobile phone sales. For feature phones as of 2016, the top-selling brands were Samsung, Nokia and Alcatel.\nMobile phones are considered an important human invention as they have been one of the most widely used and sold pieces of consumer technology. The growth in popularity has been rapid in some places; for example, in the UK, the total number of mobile phones overtook the number of houses in 1999. Today, mobile phones are globally ubiquitous, and in almost half the world's countries, over 90% of the population owns at least one.\n\n",
            "Fire Phone | The Fire Phone is a discontinued 3D-enabled smartphone developed by Amazon and manufactured by Foxconn. It was announced on June 18, 2014, and marked Amazon's first foray into the smartphone market, following the success of the Kindle Fire. It was available for pre-order on the day it was announced. In the United States, it launched as an AT&T exclusive on July 25.\nNotable for its hallmark feature \"Dynamic Perspective\" using four front-facing cameras and the gyroscope to track the user's movements, the phone's Fire OS adjusts the UI so it gives the impression of depth and 3D. Other notable Amazon services on the phone include X-Ray, used for identifying and finding information about media; Mayday, the 24-hour customer service tool; and Firefly, a tool for automatically recognizing text, sounds, and objects, and offering a way to buy recognized items through Amazon's online store.\nThe phone received mixed reviews. Critics praised the Dynamic Perspective, Firefly and, to a lesser extent, the packaged headphones, but derided the build, design, Fire OS version of Android, specifications, and exclusivity to AT&T. Amazon does not release sales figures for any of its devices, but based in part on its quickly declining prices and an announced US$170 million write-down, analysts have judged it a commercial failure. Amazon ceased production of the Fire Phone in August 2015 and discontinued sales soon after.\n\n",
            "IPhone 6 | The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple. They are the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, and were released on September 19, 2014. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus respectively include larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near-field communications-based mobile payments offering. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on September 9, 2015.\nThe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their redesign, specifications, camera, price point, and battery life as improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of their design were criticized, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. The iPhone 6 sold extremely well, making it the best-selling iPhone model and the most successful smartphone to date.  The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus supported iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 before being dropped by iOS 13.\nThe phones have been the subject of several hardware issues, including being susceptible to bending under hard pressure, and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board. Additionally, some iPhone 6 Plus models were the subject of camera issues, including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or other defects on rear cameras.\nThe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most markets on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was taken by the first-generation iPhone SE, released on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone.\n\n",

            "List of national parks of the United States | The United States has 63 national parks, which are congressionally designated protected areas operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks are designated for their natural beauty, unique geological features, diverse ecosystems, and recreational opportunities, typically \"because of some outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena. \" While legislatively all units of the National Park System are considered equal with the same mission, national parks are generally larger and more of a destination, and hunting and extractive activities are prohibited. National monuments, on the other hand, are also frequently protected for their historical or archaeological significance. Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 433 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations. A bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. \" Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS), and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR), with eight national parks in both programs. Thirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U. S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell\u2013St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192. 83 acres (0. 7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52. 4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).",

            "Tangier, Virginia | Tangier is a town in Accomack County, Virginia, United States, on Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. The population was 436 at the 2020 census. Since 1850, the island's landmass has been reduced by 67%. Under the mid-range sea level rise scenario, much of the remaining landmass is expected to be lost in the next 50 years and the town will likely need to be abandoned.\nThe people who came to permanently settle the island arrived in the 1770s, and were farmers. In the late 19th century, the islanders began to become more dependent on harvesting crabs and oysters from the Chesapeake Bay. As the waterman livelihood became more important and more lucrative, there were often conflicts among the oyster dredgers and oyster tongers in the bay, and between those living in Maryland and those living in Virginia.\nMany people who live on Tangier speak a distinctive dialect of Southern American English. Scholars have disputed how much of the dialect is derived from British English lexicon and phonetics, particularly from Cornish. Linguist David Shores has argued that there is little evidence for this claim and, while the Tangier dialect is distinctive, it is more likely a mixture of several regional dialects on the Eastern Seaboard. The persistence of this dialectal variety is often attributed to the geographic isolation of the population from the mainland. Tangier Island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

He scored 11 goals in 111 games as a midfielder for the club. His defensive abilities caught the attention of Real Madrid, and he joined the club on loan in January 2013. He played 15 games for Real Madrid Castilla during his loan spell. Afterward, he was signed permanently by Real Madrid for a fee of \u00a35.1 million, becoming a part of their first-team squad at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.\\nAfter joining Real Madrid, Casemiro initially struggled to break into the first team. He was loaned to FC Porto for \u20ac15 million to gain more playing time. During his time at Porto, Casemiro performed impressively and helped the team reach the Champions League quarterfinals. Real Madrid decided to reacquire him for \u20ac7.00m in the summer transfer window of 2015. After returning to the club, Casemiro played a crucial role in Real Madrid's success, becoming one of the best defensive midfielders in the world, and winning numerous trophies including three La Liga titles, three Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, three FIFA Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, one Copa del Rey and five UEFA Champions Leagues. In 2022, he left Real Madrid and joined Manchester United for a transfer worth a reported \u20ac70.65m, winning the EFL Cup in his first season and the FA Cup the following season.\\nA full international since 2011, Casemiro was in Brazil's squad at the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups as well as four Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments, winning the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica and finishing as a runner-up in 2021.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abUEFA Champions League Anthem , officially titled as simply the \\\"Champions League\\\", is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League, written by English composer Tony Britten in 1992, and based on George Frideric Handel's Zadok the Priest. It was also the official anthem of the UEFA Women's Champions League from its creation in 2001 to the 2021 creation of an independent anthem. The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus. The lyrics are in UEFA's three official languages: English, French, and German. The chorus is set to the exclamations \\\"Die Meister! Die Besten! Les grandes \u00e9quipes! The champions!\\\"\\nThe anthem is played inside the stadium before the start of each UEFA Champions League match, in addition to the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the games. Special vocal versions of the anthem have been performed live at the UEFA Champions League final.

            "Port Arthur massacre (Australia) | The Port Arthur massacre was a mass shooting that occurred on 28 April 1996 at Port Arthur, a tourist town in the Australian state of Tasmania. The perpetrator, Martin Bryant, killed 35 people and wounded 23 others, the deadliest massacre in modern Australian history. The attack led to fundamental changes in Australia's gun laws.\nTwo of Bryant's victims were known to him personally and were killed at Seascape, a bed and breakfast property. The majority of his victims were killed in a shooting spree at the Port Arthur Historic Site, a popular tourist destination. Using two semi-automatic rifles, he began his attack at a small caf\u00e9 before moving into a nearby gift shop, killing twenty people indiscriminately in a short amount of time. Many others were killed at the site's car park, including several children. After killing its four occupants, Bryant stole a vehicle at the site's tollbooth and drove to a nearby service station, where he killed a woman and abducted her partner. He continued to fire at passing vehicles before finally returning to Seascape with his hostage, who was then killed. He set fire to the property but was captured the following morning.\nBryant pleaded guilty to the killings and received 35 life sentences without parole; his motives have been subject to debate. The massacre led to a reassessment of Australia's gun laws by the newly elected Howard government. The National Firearms Agreement between state and federal governments was announced within two weeks of the massacre, establishing heavy restrictions on the use of automatic and semi-automatic weapons and creating a gun buyback program, a national gun registry and a waiting period for firearm sales.\n\n",

The term social capital was in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s as a term describing a society's shared sense of identity and world view. The Marxist term for a society's shared sense of identity and world view is superstructure. In Marxist theory, the superstructure determines a society's other relationships and ideas to comprise its superstructure, including its culture, institutions, political power structures, roles, rituals and state. A third term, collective consciousness, can be defined as the set of shared beliefs, ideas and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society. In general, collective consciousness does not refer to the specifically moral conscience but to a shared understanding of social norms."

            "Quit India Movement | The Quit India Movement was a movement launched at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942, during World War II, demanding an end to British rule in India. After Britain failed to secure Indian support for the British war effort with the Cripps Mission, Gandhi made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. Viceroy Linlithgow described the movement as \"by far the most serious rebellion since 1857\".\nThe All India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called \"An Orderly British Withdrawal\" from India. Even though it was at war, Britain was prepared to act. Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi's speech. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy's Council, of the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement. The major outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands.\nThe movement included anti-British boycotts and rejection of transactions involving the colonial government. Various violent incidents took place around the country against British rule, and the colonial government arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the issue for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully. The movement ended in 1945 with the release of all jailed nationalists. Prominent independence activists who died during the movement included Mukunda Kakati, Matangini Hazra, Kanaklata Barua, Kushal Konwar, Bhogeswari Phukanani and others.

            "Indian National Congress | The Indian National Congress (INC), colloquially the Congress Party, or simply the Congress, is a big tent political party in India. It is one of the two major Indian political parties alongside the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the oldest party in India. Founded on 28 December 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement. The Congress was one of the parties who led India to independence from the United Kingdom, and significantly influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire. The INC is a \"big tent\" party that has been described as sitting on the centre of the Indian political spectrum. The party held its first session in 1885 in Bombay where W. C. Bonnerjee presided over it. After Indian independence in 1947, Congress emerged as a catch-all, Indian nationalist and secular party, dominating Indian politics for the next 50 years. The party's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, led the Congress to support socialist policies by creating the Planning Commission, introducing Five-Year Plans, implementing a mixed economy, and establishing a secular state. After Nehru's death and the short tenure of Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi became the leader of the party. In the 17 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on seven occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further three times, heading the central government for more than 54 years. There have been six prime ministers from the Congress party, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947\u20131964), and the most recent being Manmohan Singh (2004\u20132014). Since the 1990s, the Bharatiya Janata Party has emerged as the main rival of the Congress in both national and regional politics. In 1969, the party suffered a major split, with a faction led by Indira Gandhi leaving to form the Congress (R), with the remainder becoming the Congress (O). The Congress (R) became the dominant faction, winning the 1971 general election by a huge margin. From 1975 to 1977, Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India, resulting in widespread oppression and abuses of power. Another split in the party occurred in 1979, leading to the creation of the Congress (I), which was recognised as the Congress by the Election Commission in 1981. Under Rajiv Gandhi's leadership, the party won a massive victory in the 1984 general elections, nevertheless losing the election held in 1989 to the National Front. The Congress then returned to power under P. V. Narasimha Rao, who moved the party towards an economically liberal agenda, a sharp break from previous leaders. However, it lost the 1996 general election and was replaced in government by the National Front."

            "History of Lesotho | The history of people living in the area now known as Lesotho () goes back thousands of years. Present Lesotho (then called Basotholand) emerged as a single polity under King Moshoeshoe I in 1822. Under Moshoeshoe I, Basotho joined other clans in their struggle against the Lifaqane associated with famine and the reign of Shaka Zulu from 1818 to 1828.\nThe subsequent evolution of the state was shaped by contact with the British and Dutch colonists from Cape Colony. Missionaries invited by Moshoeshoe I developed orthography and printed works in the Sesotho language between 1837 and 1855. The country set up diplomatic channels and acquired guns for use against the encroaching Europeans and the Korana people. Territorial conflicts with both British and Boer settlers arose periodically, including Moshoeshoe's notable victory over the Boers in the Free State\u2013Basotho War, but the final war in 1867 with an appeal to Queen Victoria, who agreed to make Basutoland a British suzerainty. In 1869, the British signed a treaty at Aliwal with the Boers that defined the boundaries of Basotholand and later Lesotho, which by ceding the western territories effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size.\nThe extent to which the British exerted direct control over Basotholand waxed and waned until Basotholand\u2019s independence in 1966 when it became the Kingdom of Lesotho. However, when the ruling Basotho National Party (BNP) lost the first post-independence general elections to the Basotho Congress Party (BCP), Leabua Jonathan refused to cede and declared himself Tona Kholo (Sesotho translation of prime minister). The BCP began an insurrection that culminated in a January 1986 military coup, that then forced the BNP out of office. Power was transferred to King Moshoeshoe II, until then a ceremonial monarch, but forced into exile when he lost favor with the military the following year. His son was installed as King Letsie III. Conditions remained tumultuous, including an August 1994 self-coup by Letsie III, until 1998 when the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) came to power in elections that were deemed fair by international observers. Despite protests from opposition parties, the country has remained relatively stable since.",
            "Battle of Blood River | The Battle of Blood River or Voortrekker-Zulu War (16 December 1838) was fought on the bank of the Ncome River, in what is today KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 464 Voortrekkers (\"Pioneers\"), led by Andries Pretorius, and an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 Zulu. Estimations of casualties amounted to over 3,000 of King Dingane's soldiers dead, including two Zulu princes competing with Prince Mpande for the Zulu throne. Three Voortrekker commando members were lightly wounded, including Pretorius.\n\nThe year 1838 was the most difficult period for the Voortrekkers from when they left the Cape Colony, till the end of the Great Trek. They faced many difficulties and much bloodshed before they found freedom and a safe homeland in their Republic of Natalia. This was only achieved after defeating the Zulu Kingdom, at the Battle of Blood River, which took place on Sunday 16 December 1838. This battle would not have taken place if the Zulu King had honoured the agreement that he had made with the Voortrekkers to live together peacefully. The Zulu king knew that they outnumbered the Voortrekkers and decided to overthrow them and that led to the Battle of Blood River.\nIn January 1840 Prince Mpande finally defeated King Dingane in the Battle of Maqongqe and was subsequently crowned as new king of the Zulu by his alliance partner Andries Pretorius. After these two battles, Dingane's prime minister and commander in the Battle of Blood River, General Ndlela, who had also been Mpande\u2019s personal protector, was strangled to death by Dingane for high treason."

Are you then saying that there were Boers who trekked into the eastern Cape who were in fact not Trekboers?', 'title': 'Talk:Trekboers - Wikipedia', 'link': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Trekboers'}\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abNatalia Republic , due to its discovery on Christmas (\\\"Natal\\\" is the Portuguese word for Christmas). The republic came to an end in 1843 when British forces annexed it to form the Colony of Natal. After the British annexation of the Natalia Republic, most local Voortrekkers trekked northwest into Transorangia, later known as the Orange Free State, and the South African Republic.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abHistory of Lesotho , Basotho joined other clans in their struggle against the Lifaqane associated with famine and the reign of Shaka Zulu from 1818 to 1828.\\nThe subsequent evolution of the state was shaped by contact with the British and Dutch colonists from Cape Colony. Missionaries invited by Moshoeshoe I developed orthography and printed works in the Sesotho language between 1837 and 1855. The country set up diplomatic channels and acquired guns for use against the encroaching Europeans and the Korana people. Territorial conflicts with both British and Boer settlers arose periodically, including Moshoeshoe's notable victory over the Boers in the Free State\u2013Basotho War, but the final war in 1867 with an appeal to Queen Victoria, who agreed to make Basutoland a British suzerainty. In 1869, the British signed a treaty at Aliwal with the Boers that defined the boundaries of Basotholand and later Lesotho, which by ceding the western territories effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size.\\nThe extent to which the British exerted direct control over Basotholand waxed and waned until Basotholand\u2019s independence in 1966 when it became the Kingdom of Lesotho. However, when the ruling Basotho National Party (BNP) lost the first post-independence general elections to the Basotho Congress Party (BCP), Leabua Jonathan refused to cede and declared himself Tona Kholo (Sesotho translation of prime minister). The BCP began an insurrection that culminated in a January 1986 military coup, that then forced the BNP out of office. Power was transferred to King Moshoeshoe II, until then a ceremonial monarch, but forced into exile when he lost favor with the military the following year. His son was installed as King Letsie III. Conditions remained tumultuous, including an August 1994 self-coup by Letsie III, until 1998 when the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) came to power in elections that were deemed fair by international observers. Despite protests from opposition parties, the country has remained relatively stable since.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abBattle of Blood River , in what is today KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 464 Voortrekkers (\\\"Pioneers\\\"), led by Andries Pretorius, and an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 Zulu. Estimations of casualties amounted to over 3,000 of King Dingane's soldiers dead, including two Zulu princes competing with Prince Mpande for the Zulu throne. Three Voortrekker commando members were lightly wounded, including Pretorius.\\n\\nThe year 1838 was the most difficult period for the Voortrekkers from when they left the Cape Colony, till the end of the Great Trek. They faced many difficulties and much bloodshed before they found freedom and a safe homeland in their Republic of Natalia. This was only achieved after defeating the Zulu Kingdom, at the Battle of Blood River, which took place on Sunday 16 December 1838. This battle would not have taken place if the Zulu King had honoured the agreement that he had made with the Voortrekkers to live together peacefully. The Zulu king knew that they outnumbered the Voortrekkers and decided to overthrow them and that led to the Battle of Blood River.\\nIn January 1840 Prince Mpande finally defeated King Dingane in the Battle of Maqongqe and was subsequently crowned as new king of the Zulu by his alliance partner Andries Pretorius. After these two battles, Dingane's prime minister and commander in the Battle of Blood River, General Ndlela, who had also been Mpande\u2019s personal protector, was strangled to death by Dingane for high treason.\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"When did the voortrekkers arrive in south africa?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": {\n    \"DQ 1\": \"When did the Voortrekkers start the Great Trek into the interior of South Africa?\",\n    \"DA 1\": \"1830s\"\n  },\n  \"Answer\": \"The Voortrekkers' arrival in South Africa can refer to different events depending on the context.

            "List of chief ministers from the Indian National Congress | The Indian National Congress (INC) is one of the two major parties in the political system of the Republic of India. As of 20 November 2024, INC is in power in the three states: Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. In Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand, it shares power with alliance partners Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha respectively. In the post-independence era, the party has governed most of India's states and union territories, and by extension, has the status of a \"national party\" in India. According to the Constitution of India, at the state level, the governor is de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Therefore, the chief minister is considered the head of government in his jurisdiction. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party or coalition with a majority of seats to form the government. The chief minister is appointed by the governor, who also appoints other ministers, known as the council of ministers, based on the chief minister's advice. The council of ministers is collectively responsible to the state legislative assembly, ensuring unified support for all governmental decisions. The Chief Minister's term is normally limited to five years if they have the assembly's confidence. There are no limits to the number of terms the chief minister can serve. The deputy chief minister is a member of the state government and usually the second highest ranking executive officer of their state's council of ministers. Because the deputy chief minister is not a constitutional office, the Chief Minister has significant influence over the scope of authority and duties the deputy chief minister can perform. A deputy chief minister usually holds a cabinet portfolio such as home minister or finance minister. In the parliamentary system of government, the chief minister is treated as the \"first among equals\" in the cabinet; the position of deputy chief minister is used to bring political stability and strength within a coalition government. Five of the INC chief ministers have been women \u2013 Sucheta Kripalani for Uttar Pradesh, Nandini Satpathy for Odisha, Anwara Taimur for Assam, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal for Punjab, and Sheila Dikshit for Delhi. The longest-serving female chief minister was Sheila Dikshit, who served as the chief minister of Delhi for over fifteen years. Okram Ibobi Singh, who was chief minister of Manipur for 15 years and 11 days between March 2002 and March 2017, has been the longest-serving chief minister of the state. Tarun Gogoi held the position of chief minister in Assam for a period of 15 years and 6 days. A leader of the Indian National Congress, Virbhadra Singh holds the distinction of being the longest serving chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, holding the office from 1983 to 1990, from 1993 to 1998, from 2003 to 2007 and finally from 2012 to 2017.",

He is also implied to be the group's strongest and most skilled  racer, a title that is challenged persistently by friend and brother-in-law Brian O'Conner.\\nThe role made Diesel a Hollywood star, and he is the one with whom he is most associated. He won the 2002 and 2014 MTV Movie Awards for Best On-Screen Team with Paul Walker for his performances. Diesel has served as a producer for the franchise's later installments.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abFast & Furious (2009 film) , Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster. In the film, Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Walker) are forced to work together to avenge the murder of Toretto's lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga (John Ortiz).\\nA fourth film was announced in July 2007, with the returns of Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster confirmed shortly after that. To account for the cast seeing absences from either of the previous two installments, the film was developed to place The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) as occurring beyond the events of Fast & Furious, while the short film Los Bandoleros (2009) was produced and released. Principal photography began in early February 2008 and wrapped up in August 2008, with filming locations including Los Angeles and the Dominican Republic. Lin, Morgan, and composer Brian Tyler returned in their roles from Tokyo Drift. Fast & Furious is the first theatrical release to feature D-BOX motion. It was also the first film in the franchise to be produced by Diesel.\\nFast & Furious premiered at Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles on March 12, 2009, and was released in the United States on April 3 by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its script but praised the action sequences. It grossed $360.4 million worldwide, exceeding expectations to become the then-highest-grossing film in the franchise. It also grossed $72.5 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which made it the highest-grossing worldwide spring weekend opening until the release of Alice in Wonderland (2010). It was followed by Fast Five in 2011.\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"When was the first fast and furious film made?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": [\n    \"DQ 1: When was the first Fast and Furious film released in the United States?\",\n    \"DA 1: June 22, 2001\",\n    \"DQ 2: When was the first film in the Fast and Furious franchise, titled 'The Fast and the Furious', released in the United States?\",\n    \"DA 2: June 22, 2001\",\n    \"DQ 3: When was The Fast and the Furious released in the United States?\",\n    \"DA 3: June 22, 2001\",\n    \"DQ 4: When was the first film in the Fast and Furious franchise, titled 'The Fast and the Furious', released in the United States theatrically?\",\n    \"DA 4: December 4, 2001\"\n  ],\n  \"Answer\": \"The first film in the Fast and Furious franchise, titled 'The Fast and the Furious', was released in the United States on June 22, 2001.

It is available in seven distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas; Lego Fortnite, an open world game collection divided between survival game Lego Fortnite Odyssey and social game Lego Fortnite Brick Life; Rocket Racing, a racing game; Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game; and Fortnite Ballistic, a tactical first-person shooter currently in early access. All game modes except Save the World are free-to-play.\nSave the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019, and it has been listed among the greatest games of all time.\nSave the World is available for macOS, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative were released for all those platforms as well as Android and iOS devices and Nintendo Switch.

            "2000 Summer Olympics | The 2000 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XXVII Olympiad, officially branded as Sydney 2000, and also known as the Games of the New Millennium, were an international multi-sport event held from 15 September to 1 October 2000 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It marked the second time the Summer Olympics were held in Australia, and in the Southern Hemisphere, the first being in Melbourne, in 1956.\nTeams from 199 countries participated in the 2000 Games, which were the first to feature at least 300 events in its official sports program. The Games were estimated to have cost A$6.6 billion. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch before the arrival of his successor Jacques Rogge.\nThe final medal tally at the 2000 Summer Olympics was led by the United States, followed by Russia and China with host Australia in fourth place overall. Cameroon, Colombia, Latvia, Mozambique, and Slovenia won a gold medal for the first time in their Olympic histories, while Barbados, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam won their first-ever Olympic medals.\nThe 2000 Games received universal acclaim, with the organisation, volunteers, sportsmanship, and Australian public being lauded in the international media. Bill Bryson of The Times called the Sydney Games \"one of the most successful events on the world stage\", saying that they \"couldn't be better\". James Mossop of the Electronic Telegraph called the Games \"such a success that any city considering bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney\", while Jack Todd of the Montreal Gazette suggested that the \"IOC should quit while it's ahead. Admit there can never be a better Olympic Games, and be done with it,\" as \"Sydney was both exceptional and the best\". These games would provide the inspiration for London's winning bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005; in preparing for the 2012 Games, Lord Coe declared the 2000 Games the \"benchmark for the spirit of the Games, unquestionably\", admitting that the London organizing committee \"attempted in several ways to emulate what the Sydney Organising Committee did.\" This is also the first Olympics to take place fully in Australia because the 1956 Melbourne Olympics had equestrian events take place in Stockholm because of Australia's strict quarantine regulations.\nAustralia will host the Summer Olympics in Brisbane in 2032, making it the first Asia-Pacific country to host the Summer Olympics three times.\n\n",

The king \u2013 not Parliament \u2013 chose him; and the king \u2013 not Walpole \u2013 chose the Cabinet. Walpole set an example, not a precedent, and few followed his example.

Great Reform Act and the premiership British prime ministers have never been elected directly by the public. A prime minister need not be a party leader; David Lloyd George was not a party leader during his tenure during World War I, and neither was Ramsay MacDonald from 1931 to 1935. Prime ministers have taken office because they were members of either the Commons or Lords, and either inherited a majority in the Commons or won more seats than the opposition in a general election.

                    "How I Met Your Mother, often abbreviated as HIMYM, is an American sitcom, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby, played by Josh Radnor, who narrates the story of how he met the mother of his children. The series begins in September 2005 with Ted as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years: law student Marshall Eriksen, played byJason Segel, and kindergarten teacher and an aspiring artist Lily Aldrin, played by Alyson Hannigan. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends, including the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin, womanizing playboy Barney Stinson, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky, played by Cobie Smulders. While the traditional love story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other, \"How I Met Your Mother\" does not introduce Ted's wife, played by Cristin Milioti, until the eighth-season finale and only announces her name, Tracy McConnell, during the series finale."

In 596, Pope Gregory I ordered a Gregorian mission to be launched in order to convert the Anglo-Saxons to the Roman Catholic denomination of Christianity. The leader of this mission, Augustine, probably landed in Thanet, then part of the Kingdom of Kent, in the summer of 597. The courts of the East Anglians and the Gewisse were converted by continental missionaries Felix of Burgundy and Birinus the Italian from 625 to 642. The deities of this religion provided the basis for the names of the days of the week in the English language. What is known about the religion and its accompanying mythology have since influenced both literature and Modern Paganism."

It established the principle that dynastic rights were secondary to maintaining the balance of power between different countries. When Emperor Joseph I died in 1711, Archduke Charles succeeded his brother as emperor, and the new British government initiated peace talks. Since only British subsidies kept their allies in the war, this resulted in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, followed by the August 1714 Treaties of Rastatt and Baden. On 7 September 1714, the Holy Roman Empire joined the agreement by the Treaty of Baden. Although Catalonia and Majorca were not finally subdued by the Bourbons until June 1715, the war was over."

Starting from the 1984\u201385 NBA season, the NBA's first salary cap was introduced. The NBA salary cap is the maximum dollar amount each NBA team can spend on its players for the season. However, the NBA uses a \\\"soft\\\" salary cap, which allow NBA teams to exceed their allotted amount in order to sign players through significant \\\"salary exceptions\\\". The salary cap is determined during the offseason, but is liable to change. An exception is necessary to sign a player for a contract that would exceed the salary cap threshold of the \\\"soft cap\\\".\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"Who's the highest paid nba player 2017?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": \"DQ 1: Who was the highest paid NBA player in the 2017-2018 season?\\nDA 1: Russell Westbrook\\nDQ 2: Who was the highest paid NBA player in the 2016-2017 season?\\nDA 2: LeBron James\",\n  \"Answer\": \"The question \\\"Who's the highest paid NBA player 2017?\\\" is ambiguous because it is unclear whether it refers to the 2016-2017 season or the 2017-2018 season.

He was first introduced in Star Wars, the first movie of the original film trilogy, as the secondary antagonist and one of the leaders of the Galactic Empire. He has become one of the most iconic villains of cinema.\nThe prequel trilogy chronicles Vader's childhood as a precocious human slave named Anakin Skywalker, liberation by the Jedi Order, and young adulthood as a morally conflicted Jedi Knight, under the mentorship of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Skywalker is secretly lured into the Sith warrior cult by the Galactic Republic politician Palpatine. When Palpatine seizes control of the galaxy as its Emperor, Skywalker betrays the Jedi Order and, during a duel with Kenobi, is severely mutilated and thereafter transformed into a cyborg whom Palpatine rebrands as the Sith lord Darth Vader. He serves the Emperor for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance who oppose the new Empire. Finally, when Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son Luke, the Sith lord turns against his master, leading to the mutual destruction of Palpatine and Vader, which effectively brings the Empire to its end.\nIn secret, Vader is the husband of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the father of Luke Skywalker and his twin sister Leia Organa, and the grandfather of Ben Solo (later known as Kylo Ren).\nDavid Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original trilogy, while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and some television series. Sebastian Shaw portrays Anakin in Return of the Jedi (1983), while Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portray Anakin in the prequel trilogy, with Christensen reprising the role in the series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Ahsoka (2023).

Skywalker is secretly lured into the Sith warrior cult by the Galactic Republic politician Palpatine. When Palpatine seizes control of the galaxy as its Emperor, Skywalker betrays the Jedi Order and, during a duel with Kenobi, is severely mutilated and thereafter transformed into a cyborg whom Palpatine rebrands as the Sith lord Darth Vader. He serves the Emperor for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance who oppose the new Empire. Finally, when Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son Luke, the Sith lord turns against his master, leading to the mutual destruction of Palpatine and Vader, which effectively brings the Empire to its end.\\nIn secret, Vader is the husband of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the father of Luke Skywalker and his twin sister Leia Organa, and the grandfather of Ben Solo (later known as Kylo Ren).\\nDavid Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original trilogy, while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and some television series.

            "Christmas | Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A liturgical feast central to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.\nThe traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.\nThere are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth. In the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25, the date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. It is nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the Roman date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, celebrating that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity is more important than knowing Jesus's exact birth date.\nThe customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular holiday traditions include gift-giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and carolling; watching Christmas films; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; and displaying various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, poinsettias, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. Additionally, several related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, Christmas has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.",
            "Hanukkah | Hanukkah (, ; \u05d7\u05b2\u05e0\u05bb\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u200e \u1e24\u0103nukk\u0101 ) is a Rabbinic Jewish festival commemorating the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.\nHanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from November 28 to December 27 in the Gregorian calendar. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash (\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05de\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u200e, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.\nOther Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.\nOriginally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.\n\n",
            "Christmas music | Christmas music comprises a variety of genres of music regularly performed or heard around the Christmas season. Music associated with Christmas may be purely instrumental, or in the case of carols, may employ lyrics about the nativity of Jesus Christ, traditions such as gift-giving and merrymaking, cultural figures such as Santa Claus, or other topics. Many songs simply have a winter or seasonal theme, or have been adopted into the canon for other reasons.\nTraditional Christmas carols include pieces such as \"Silent Night\", \"O Holy Night\", \"Down in Yon Forest\", \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\". While most Christmas songs before the 20th century were of a traditional religious character and reflected the Nativity story of Christmas, the Great Depression brought a stream of widely popular songs of U.S. origin that did not explicitly mention the Christian nature of the holiday, but rather the more cultural themes and customs associated with it. These included songs aimed at children such as \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", as well as sentimental ballad-type songs performed by famous crooners of the era, such as \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", \"Blue Christmas\" and \"White Christmas\", the latter of which remained the best-selling single of all time as of 2024. Elvis' Christmas Album (1957) by Elvis Presley is the best-selling Christmas album of all time, having sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nPerformances of Christmas music at public concerts, in churches, at shopping malls, on city streets, and in private gatherings are a staple of the Christmas season in many cultures across the world. Many radio stations convert to a 24/7 Christmas music format leading up to the holiday, though the standard for most stations in the US is on or near Veterans Day, some stations adopt the format as early as the day after Halloween (or, exceptionally rarely, even sooner) as part of a phenomenon known as \"Christmas creep\". Liturgically, Christmas music traditionally ceases to be performed at the arrival of Candlemas, the traditional end of the Christmas-Epiphanytide season.\n\n"

            "Right-to-work law | In the context of labor law in the United States, the term right-to-work laws refers to state laws that prohibit union security agreements between employers and labor unions. Such agreements can be incorporated into union contracts to require employees who are not union members to contribute to the costs of union representation.

Generally listed as the youngest apostle, he was the son of Zebedee and Salome. His brother James was another of the Twelve Apostles. The Church Fathers identify him as John the Evangelist, John of Patmos, John the Elder, and the Beloved Disciple, and claim that he outlived the remaining apostles and was the only one to die of natural causes, although modern scholars are divided on the veracity of these claims. \n\nJohn the Apostle is traditionally held to be the author of the Gospel of John, and many Christian denominations believe that he authored several other books of the New Testament (the three Johannine epistles and the Book of Revelation, together with the Gospel of John, are called the Johannine works), depending on whether he is distinguished from, or identified with, John the Evangelist, John the Elder, and John of Patmos.\nAlthough the authorship of the Johannine works has traditionally been attributed to John the Apostle, only a minority of contemporary scholars believe he wrote the gospel, and most conclude that he wrote none of them. Regardless of whether or not John the Apostle wrote any of the Johannine works, most scholars agree that all three epistles were written by the same author and that the epistles did not have the same author as the Book of Revelation, although there is widespread disagreement among scholars as to whether the author of the epistles was different from that of the gospel.\n\n",

Generally listed as the youngest apostle, he was the son of Zebedee and Salome. His brother James was another of the Twelve Apostles. The Church Fathers identify him as John the Evangelist, John of Patmos, John the Elder, and the Beloved Disciple, and claim that he outlived the remaining apostles and was the only one to die of natural causes, although modern scholars are divided on the veracity of these claims. \\n\\nJohn the Apostle is traditionally held to be the author of the Gospel of John, and many Christian denominations believe that he authored several other books of the New Testament (the three Johannine epistles and the Book of Revelation, together with the Gospel of John, are called the Johannine works), depending on whether he is distinguished from, or identified with, John the Evangelist, John the Elder, and John of Patmos.\\nAlthough the authorship of the Johannine works has traditionally been attributed to John the Apostle, only a minority of contemporary scholars believe he wrote the gospel, and most conclude that he wrote none of them. Regardless of whether or not John the Apostle wrote any of the Johannine works, most scholars agree that all three epistles were written by the same author and that the epistles did not have the same author as the Book of Revelation, although there is widespread disagreement among scholars as to whether the author of the epistles was different from that of the gospel.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abFirst Epistle to the Corinthians , part of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle is attributed to Paul the Apostle and a co-author, Sosthenes, and is addressed to the Christian church in Corinth. Scholars believe that Sosthenes was the amanuensis who wrote down the text of the letter at Paul's direction. It addresses various issues which had arisen in the Christian community at Corinth and is composed in a form of Koine Greek. Despite the name, it is not believed to be the first such letter written to the Corinthian church.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00ab{'snippet': 'More wrote a series of books and pamphlets in English and Latin to respond to Protestants, and in his official capacities took action against the illegal book trade, notably fronting a diplomatically-sensitive raid in 1525 of the Hanseatic Merchants in the Steelyard in his role as chancellor of the ...', 'title': 'Thomas More - Wikipedia', 'link': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More'}\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abForged (book) , published in 2011 by HarperCollins.

            "Parallel syntax | In rhetoric, parallel syntax (also known as parallel construction, parallel structure, and parallelism) is a rhetorical device that consists of repetition among adjacent sentences or clauses.  The repeated sentences or clauses provide emphasis to a central theme or idea the author is trying to convey. Parallelism is the mark of a mature language speaker.\nIn language, syntax is the structure of a sentence, thus parallel syntax can also be called parallel sentence structure. This rhetorical tool improves the flow of a sentence as it adds a figure of balance to sentences it is implemented into. It also aids in making the sentence more concise by eliminating unnecessary words that could distract the reader from the main idea and following a clear pattern of language. It is a simple way to achieve clarity and avoid ambiguity, but it is avoided unless the relationship of the ideas or details they express justifies parallelism. Parallel structure is like the derived conjunction analysis because it assumes several underlying complete sentences.\nIn addition to providing emphasis, it is evident that parallel structure appeals to the reader or listener in a variety of ways as well.  Primarily, the repetition of clauses promotes a heightened mental ability to process the sentence as a whole; studies have shown that the reiteration of the second clause will increase the speed an individual can process the sentence.  Furthermore, it decreases the load of information needed to be processed by the reader, facilitating comprehension. Because it is more appealing, it is also more persuasive.  \nAccording to Aristotle, persuasion is created through parallel syntax by means of repetition.  Recapping crucial aspects of an argument through properly created phrases and clauses further embeds the idea into the listener, ultimately resulting in persuasion.  However, these clauses must be created precisely, in a way similar to poetry, in order to maximize the effect.  For example, paired sentences, phrases, or clauses must be created with equal structure in regards to verb and noun choice, along with both number of syllables and meter; according to Aristotle, the more ways in which these aspects match, the more persuasive the argument will be. Faulty parallelism most often occurs with coordinating conjunctions that connect nouns and adjectives.\nUsing parallel syntax among two clauses is known as an isocolon, when among three clauses it is known as a tricolon.  Having similar syntactical structure among clauses or phrases helps the reader identify the similarity of ideas proposed within them. Isocolon is made up of the Greek words iso (equal) and kolon (member), so each part or clause is the same length. A tricolon has 3 clauses that do not need to be the same length. An isocolon can be a tricolon but a tricolon cannot be an isocolon.\nParallel syntax is often used in conjunction with antithesis, anaphora, asyndeton, climax, epistrophe and symploce.",

Later, in 2012, curators at the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK, were able to take the original custom-format nitrate film copied to black-and-white 35 mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by telecine and digital image processing was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image so that these films from 1902 could become viewable in full color. The first feature length film that was made entirely in three-strip Technicolor, which was an early process where color filters were used to photograph the color components as completely separate images, came out on June 13, 1935."

In some cases, this will be a single individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by committees. There are two kinds of committee structure. A single committee known as a board of directors is the method favored in most common law countries. A two-tiered committee structure with a supervisory board and a managing board is common in civil law countries.

Following World War II, in 1946, Georges Doriot, the \"father of venture capitalism\" along with Ralph Flanders and Karl Compton founded American Research and Development Corporation or ARDC to encourage private-sector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from World War II. ARDC became the first institutional private-equity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families. Then, in 1958, one of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry in the United States was the passage of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 provided tax breaks that helped contribute to the rise of private equity firms. Then in 1959, it is commonly noted that the first venture-backed startup, Fairchild Semiconductor, was funded by what would later become Venrock Associates. Venrock, a compound of \"Venture\" and \"Rockefeller\" is a venture capital firm formed in 1969 to build upon the successful investing activities of the Rockefeller family that began in the late 1930s."

The third-year center had already set season scoring records in his first two seasons. During the fourth quarter, the Knicks began fouling other players to keep the ball away from Chamberlain, and they also became deliberate on offense to reduce the number of possessions for Philadelphia. The Warriors countered by committing fouls of their own to get the ball back.\nThe game was not televised, and no video footage of the game has been recovered; there are only audio recordings of the game's fourth quarter, which was added for preservation in the United States' National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2016.

            "The Wall | The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records. It is a rock opera which explores Pink, a jaded rock star, as he constructs a psychological \"wall\" of social isolation. The Wall topped the US charts for 15 weeks and reached number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time.\nThe bassist, Roger Waters, conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh tour, modelling the character of Pink after himself and the former member Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. The producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band members were struggling with personal and financial problems. The keyboardist, Richard Wright, was fired by Waters during production but stayed on during the tour as a salaried musician.\nThree singles were issued: \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (Pink Floyd's only UK and US number-one single), \"Run Like Hell\", and \"Comfortably Numb\". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature film written by Waters.\nThe Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second-best-selling Pink Floyd album behind The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the best-selling double album of all time, and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Some outtakes sessions were used on the next Pink Floyd album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new The Wall live tour that became one of the highest-grossing tours by a solo musician. In 2011, Waters declared The Wall to be his favourite album he recorded with Pink Floyd.",

He co-wrote it with Bill Montague. It became a top ten hit for him when the song peaked at No. 3 in the Country Singles chart in 1966.', 'title': \\\"Talkin' to the Wall - Wikipedia\\\", 'link': \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkin'_to_the_Wall\\\"}\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abThe Wall , released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records. It is a rock opera which explores Pink, a jaded rock star, as he constructs a psychological \\\"wall\\\" of social isolation. The Wall topped the US charts for 15 weeks and reached number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time.\\nThe bassist, Roger Waters, conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh tour, modelling the character of Pink after himself and the former member Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. The producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band members were struggling with personal and financial problems. The keyboardist, Richard Wright, was fired by Waters during production but stayed on during the tour as a salaried musician.\\nThree singles were issued: \\\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\\" (Pink Floyd's only UK and US number-one single), \\\"Run Like Hell\\\", and \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature film written by Waters.\\nThe Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second-best-selling Pink Floyd album behind The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the best-selling double album of all time, and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Some outtakes sessions were used on the next Pink Floyd album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the \\\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\\". From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new The Wall live tour that became one of the highest-grossing tours by a solo musician. In 2011, Waters declared The Wall to be his favourite album he recorded with Pink Floyd.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00ab{'snippet': '\\\" The Wall \\\" is a song written by Kerry Livgren and Steve Walsh that was first released on Kansas \\\\' 1976 album Leftoverture.

This series was a 1990s television adaption of the 1966 novel about the lives of various glamorous women living in Southern California. Valley of the Dolls is also a 1967 American drama film based on Jacqueline Susann's novel. In this film adaptation, Judy Garland was originally cast as Helen; however, she was replaced by Susan Hayward. Garland was fired when she reportedly came to work drunk. Susan Hayward replaced her in the role after production had already started. On July 20, 2009, Patty Duke told an audience at a screening of the film at the Castro Theater in San Francisco that director Mark Robson made Garland wait from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm before filming her scenes for the day, knowing that Garland would be upset and drunk by that time. In Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls, another adaptation, Jean Simmons played Helen Lawson.

Additionally, even if he is correct, it's unlikely it produced any significant beneficial effects treating beta-thalassemia. Then, in 1990, the first approved gene therapy clinical research in the United States took place in September at the National Institutes of Health under the direction of William French Anderson. Four-year-old Ashanti DeSilva received treatment for a genetic defect that left her with ADA-SCID, a severe immune system deficiency. The defective gene of the patient's blood cells was replaced by the functional variant. Ashanti's immune system was partially restored by the therapy. Production of the missing enzyme was temporarily stimulated; however, the new cells with functional genes were not generated.

This phrase gives three examples of the unalienable rights which the Declaration says have been given to all humans by their creator and which governments are created to protect. Like the other principles in the Declaration of Independence, this phrase is not legally binding but has been widely referenced and seen as an inspiration for the basis of government. The U.S. Declaration of Independence also includes the right of revolution. In political philosophy, the right of revolution is the right or duty of a people to alter, abolish or throw off such Government that acts against their common interests and/or threatens the safety of the people without cause.

The view of the bridge, the Harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is widely regarded as an iconic image of Sydney, and of Australia itself. Nicknamed \"the Coathanger\" because of its arch-based design, the bridge carries rail, vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.\nUnder the direction of John Bradfield of the New South Wales Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long of Middlesbrough, and opened in 1932. The bridge's general design, which Bradfield tasked the NSW Department of Public Works with producing, was a rough copy of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. The design chosen from the tender responses was original work created by Dorman Long, who leveraged some of the design from its own Tyne Bridge.\nIt is the eleventh-longest spanning-arch bridge in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134 m (440 ft) from top to water level. It was also the world's widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 m (160 ft) wide, until construction of the new Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver was completed in 2012.",

            "Timeline of Sydney Harbour ferries | Sydney Harbour ferry services date back to the first years of Sydney's European settlement. Slow and sporadic boats ran along the Parramatta River from Sydney to Parramatta and served the agricultural settlements in between. By the mid-1830s, speculative ventures established regular services. From the late-nineteenth century the North Shore developed rapidly. A rail connection to Milsons Point took alighting ferry passengers up the North Shore line to Hornsby, New South Wales via North Sydney. Without a bridge connection, increasingly large fleets of steamers serviced the cross harbour routes and in the early twentieth century, Sydney Ferries Limited was the largest ferry operator in the world.\nHowever, arguably the most well-known is the Manly ferry service, and its large ship-like ferries that negotiate the beam swells of the Sydney Heads. From the mid-nineteenth century, the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company and its forerunners ran commuter and weekend excursion services to the beach-side suburb.\nThe 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge dramatically and permanently changed Sydney Harbour. Sydney Ferries Limited annual patronage fell from 40 million to 15 million almost immediately. The hardships of the Great Depression and Second World War slowed the ferries' decline, but by 1951 the NSW State Government was forced to take over the ailing Sydney Ferries Limited. The Manly service fared better, and the Port Jackson company's peak year was 1946, after which a slow decline saw it too taken over by the NSW State Government in the 1970s. Ferry operations were privatised in 2015 with vessels and facilities remaining in public ownership.\nSydney's first ferries were sail and/or oar powered and by the mid-19th century, paddle steamers were well established. Double-ended ferries became common as they did not require turning at terminating wharves in Sydney's busy but narrow bays, including the main hub at Circular Quay. Double-ender ferries, however, provided technological challenges for screw (propeller) propulsion and Sydney's shift from paddle steamers to screw ferries in the closing years of the nineteenth century was relatively late. Diesel power first came to Sydney Harbour ferries mainly through the conversion of existing steam ferries to diesel in the 1930s and the 1950s, as ferry companies could generally not afford new ferries in the slow post-Bridge decades. Hydrofoils were introduced to the Manly run in the 1960s and 1970s halving travel times for those willing to pay a premium fare. Government investment in new vessels during the 1970s and 1980s saw the replacement of the surviving early twentieth century vessels. New vessels included modern Lady-class ferries, four large Manly ferries, and nine First-Fleet ferries. The most recent decades have seen the introduction of the RiverCats, JetCats, SuperCats and in 2017, the Emerald-class ferries. Apart from the four Manly \"Freshwater-class\" ferries, the current Sydney Ferries fleet comprises all catamarans."

The central character in Homer's Iliad, he was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, king of Phthia and famous Argonaut. Achilles was raised in Phthia along with his childhood companion Patroclus and received his education by the centaur Chiron. In the Iliad, he is presented as the commander of the mythical tribe of the Myrmidons.\nAchilles's most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with Statius's unfinished epic Achilleid, written in the first century CE) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel. According to that myth, when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river Styx as an infant, she held him by one of his heels, leaving it untouched by the waters and thus his only vulnerable body part.\nAlluding to these legends, the term Achilles' heel has come to mean a point of weakness which can lead to downfall, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The Achilles tendon is named after him following the same legend.",

            "American entry into World War I | The United States entered into World War I on 6 April 1917, more than two and a half years after the war began in Europe. Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British and an anti-tsarist element sympathizing with Germany's war against Russia, American public opinion had generally reflected a desire to stay out of the war. Over time, especially after reports of German atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in a torpedo attack by a submarine of the Imperial German Navy off the southern coast of Ireland in May 1915, Americans increasingly came to see Imperial Germany as the aggressor in Europe.\nWhile the country was at peace, American banks made huge loans to the Entente powers (Allies), which were used mainly to buy munitions, raw materials, and food from across the Atlantic in North America from the United States and Canada. Although president Woodrow Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war before 1917, he did authorize a shipbuilding program for the United States Navy. Wilson was narrowly re-elected in 1916 on an anti-war platform.\nBy 1917, with Belgium and northern France occupied by German troops, the Russian Empire experiencing turmoil and upheaval in the February Revolution overthrowing the tsar on the Eastern Front, and with the remaining Entente nations low on credit, the German empire appeared to have the upper hand in Europe. However, a British economic embargo and naval blockade were causing severe shortages of fuel and food in Germany. Berlin then decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. The aim was to break the trans-Atlantic supply chain to Britain from other nations to the West, although the German high command realized that sinking American-flagged ships would almost certainly bring the United States into the war.\nImperial Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories of the Mexican Cession of 1849, lost seven decades before in the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u20131848, (now incorporated in the Southwestern United States) in an encoded diplomatic secret telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram intercepted by British intelligence. Publication in the media of that communique outraged Americans just as German submarines started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic in their U-boat campaign. President Wilson then asked Congress for \"a war to end all wars\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917. US troops began to arrive in Europe later that year, and served in major combat operations on the Western Front under the command of general John J. Pershing, particularly during the final Hundred Days Offensive.\n\n",
            "The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories; invasions of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; and Germany's unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. On 6 and 9 August, the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Faced with an imminent Allied invasion, the prospect of further atomic bombings, and a Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August, and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945. World War II transformed the political, economic, and social structures of the world, and established the foundation of international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The United Nations was created to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US\u2014becoming the permanent members of its security council. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the half-century Cold War. In the wake of Europe's devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and of Asia. Many countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.",
            "United States in World War I | The United States became directly involved in World War I after declaring war on Germany on April 6, 1917. The declaration ended nearly three years of American neutrality in the war since the beginning, and the country's involvement in the conflict lasted for nineteen months before a ceasefire and armistice were declared on November 11, 1918. The U.S. played a major role in providing much needed supplies, raw material, and money to the United Kingdom, France, and the other Allied powers, even well before 1917.\nAfter declaring war, the U.S. mobilized over 5 million military personnel. General John J. Pershing commanded the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France, in which over 2 million American soldiers served. American troops began to arrive in Europe by June 1917, first at a slow rate, but by the summer of 1918 the rate had skyrocketed to 10,000 soldiers arriving each day. Most of the ground fighting for the U.S. took place on the Western Front. At sea, the U.S. Navy would play a key role in the Allied convoy system and in the ongoing battle against German submarines. Over 116,000 American servicemen were lost in the war.\nAlthough there was an initially slow start in mobilizing the armed forces, economy and labor force, by spring 1918, the nation was poised to play a role in the conflict. Under the leadership of President Woodrow Wilson, the war saw a dramatic expansion of the United States government in an attempt to harness the war effort and to significantly increase in the size of the U.S. Armed Forces. The war also represented the climax of the Progressive Era, as it sought to bring reform and democracy to the world.\n\n",

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British and an anti-tsarist element sympathizing with Germany's war against Russia, American public opinion had generally reflected a desire to stay out of the war. Over time, especially after reports of German atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in a torpedo attack by a submarine of the Imperial German Navy off the southern coast of Ireland in May 1915, Americans increasingly came to see Imperial Germany as the aggressor in Europe.\\nWhile the country was at peace, American banks made huge loans to the Entente powers (Allies), which were used mainly to buy munitions, raw materials, and food from across the Atlantic in North America from the United States and Canada. Although president Woodrow Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war before 1917, he did authorize a shipbuilding program for the United States Navy. Wilson was narrowly re-elected in 1916 on an anti-war platform.\\nBy 1917, with Belgium and northern France occupied by German troops, the Russian Empire experiencing turmoil and upheaval in the February Revolution overthrowing the tsar on the Eastern Front, and with the remaining Entente nations low on credit, the German empire appeared to have the upper hand in Europe. However, a British economic embargo and naval blockade were causing severe shortages of fuel and food in Germany. Berlin then decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. The aim was to break the trans-Atlantic supply chain to Britain from other nations to the West, although the German high command realized that sinking American-flagged ships would almost certainly bring the United States into the war.\\nImperial Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories of the Mexican Cession of 1849, lost seven decades before in the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u20131848, (now incorporated in the Southwestern United States) in an encoded diplomatic secret telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram intercepted by British intelligence. Publication in the media of that communique outraged Americans just as German submarines started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic in their U-boat campaign. President Wilson then asked Congress for \\\"a war to end all wars\\\" that would \\\"make the world safe for democracy\\\", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917. US troops began to arrive in Europe later that year, and served in major combat operations on the Western Front under the command of general John J. Pershing, particularly during the final Hundred Days Offensive.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories; invasions of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; and Germany's unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. On 6 and 9 August, the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Faced with an imminent Allied invasion, the prospect of further atomic bombings, and a Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August, and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945. World War II transformed the political, economic, and social structures of the world, and established the foundation of international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The United Nations was created to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US\u2014becoming the permanent members of its security council. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the half-century Cold War. In the wake of Europe's devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and of Asia. Many countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abUnited States in World War I , 1917. The declaration ended nearly three years of American neutrality in the war since the beginning, and the country's involvement in the conflict lasted for nineteen months before a ceasefire and armistice were declared on November 11, 1918. The U.S. played a major role in providing much needed supplies, raw material, and money to the United Kingdom, France, and the other Allied powers, even well before 1917.\\nAfter declaring war, the U.S. mobilized over 5 million military personnel. General John J. Pershing commanded the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France, in which over 2 million American soldiers served. American troops began to arrive in Europe by June 1917, first at a slow rate, but by the summer of 1918 the rate had skyrocketed to 10,000 soldiers arriving each day. Most of the ground fighting for the U.S. took place on the Western Front. At sea, the U.S. Navy would play a key role in the Allied convoy system and in the ongoing battle against German submarines. Over 116,000 American servicemen were lost in the war.\\nAlthough there was an initially slow start in mobilizing the armed forces, economy and labor force, by spring 1918, the nation was poised to play a role in the conflict. Under the leadership of President Woodrow Wilson, the war saw a dramatic expansion of the United States government in an attempt to harness the war effort and to significantly increase in the size of the U.S. Armed Forces. The war also represented the climax of the Progressive Era, as it sought to bring reform and democracy to the world.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[5] \u00ab{'snippet': 'The United States , while providing some materiel support to European Allies since September 1940, remained formally neutral until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, after which it declared war and officially joined the Allies.', 'title': 'Allies of World War II - Wikipedia', 'link': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II'}\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"When did the us enter the second world war in europe?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": \"DQ 1: When did the US military first engage in Operation Torch in Europe during WWII?\\nDA 1: November 8, 1942\\nDQ 2: When did the US declare war and officially join the Allies in WWII in Europe?\\nDA 2: December 1941\\nDQ 3: When did the US declare war on Japan and officially join the Allies in WWII?\\nDA 3: December 1941\\nDQ 4: When did the US declare war on Germany and officially join the Allies in WWII?\\nDA 4: December 11, 1941\\nDQ 5: When did the US declare war on Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor, thus officially joining the Allies in WWII?\\nDA 5: December 8, 1941\\nDQ 6: When did the US begin military operations in Europe during World War II?\\nDA 6: November 8, 1942\\nDQ 7: When did the US formally declare war and enter World War II, which led to involvement in Europe?\\nDA 7: December 1941\\nDQ 8: When did the US military first engage in Operation Torch?\\nDA 8: November 8, 1942\\nDQ 9: Where did the US military first engage in Operation Torch?\\nDA 9: North Africa\\nDQ 10: When did the US officially enter WWII?;\\nDA 1: December 8, 1941\\nDA 10: September 11, 1941\",\n  \"Answer\": \"The question of when the U.S. entered World War II in Europe can be interpreted in several ways.

Dissatisfied with their 1998 eponymous debut studio album, Destiny's Child sought transition from the record's neo soul-influenced sound. Hence, the group took more creative control and enlisted an almost entirely different array of collaborators, including Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, Kandi Burruss, Missy Elliott, Rodney Jerkins, and LaShawn Daniels, among others.\nA result of the substantial artistic change, The Writing's on the Wall is an R&B, pop, hip hop, and soul record. Furthermore, it incorporates unconventional sonic elements, complex arrangements and staccato rap-singing vocals. Lyrically, the album is constructed as a concept album, with each track representing a Ten Commandments-inspired \"Commandment of Relationships\". Its themes include infatuation, dependency, infidelity, and separation, while a loose religious theme is maintained throughout. The production and innovative approach earned critical acclaim, while lyrical content initially elicited criticism. However, retrospective critical commentaries saw praise directed towards the album's feminist undertones.\nThe Writing's on the Wall is widely considered Destiny's Child's breakthrough album. It debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 133,000 units, and later peaked at number five. The album went on to be certified octuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of eight million units in the US. Four singles were produced\u2014\"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Bug a Boo\", \"Say My Name\" and \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\". \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Say My Name\" became Destiny's Child's first two US Billboard Hot 100 number-ones, with the latter winning the group their first two Grammy Awards. With worldwide sales of 13 million copies, The Writing's on the Wall is one of the best selling albums by a girl group and best-selling R&B albums of all time.\nThe Writing's on the Wall was largely overshadowed by the controversy surrounding its promotional cycle as a result of the group's internal conflicts. The music video for \"Say My Name\" saw original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson\u2013who had attempted to split with their manager Mathew Knowles\u2013unexpectedly replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against Knowles and former bandmates, and Franklin departed from Destiny's Child a mere five months after joining, leaving it as a trio. Regardless of the turmoil, a multitude of publications has listed the album among the best records of its time and genre, noting the immense influence on numerous artists.\n\n",
            "Survivor (Destiny's Child album) | Survivor is the third studio album by American pop group Destiny's Child. It was released on April 25, 2001, by Columbia Records. As their breakthrough second studio album The Writing's on the Wall (1999) became a rising commercial success, Destiny's Child faced the controversial departure of original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who were replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams, in February 2000. Soon afterwards, they commenced production of their third studio album, tentatively titled Independent Women.\nMere five months after joining, Franklin departed from the group in July 2000, and \"Independent Women Part I\" was subsequently released as a single from the accompanying soundtrack for the film Charlie's Angels (2000). The song became a global commercial success and the group's third US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single. Retitling the album Survivor in reference to the turmoil surrounding their line-up alterations, Destiny's Child enlisted producers such as Anthony Dent, Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari and Keybeats alongside Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, who produced all and co-wrote nearly all of the album's tracks. Their final product was an R&B and pop record incorporating genres such as dance, funk and hip hop. Its lyrical themes explore dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.\nUpon its release, Survivor received generally positive reviews, mostly aimed at its production, while its balladry, length and lyrical content ignited criticism. Retrospective critical commentaries have credited the record for its impact on mainstream music of the 2000s and for serving as foundation for Knowles' eventual solo career. A global commercial success, the album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 units, becoming Destiny's Child's first and only number-one studio album on the chart. It has gone on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), the album was nominated for Best R&B Album. By 2004, it had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, being among the best-selling girl group albums of all time.\nSurvivor produced four singles. Its title track peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top ten in 18 additional countries. In 2002, it won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"Bootylicious\" became Destiny's Child's fourth US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single and attained international success. \"Emotion\" became a US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit in the wake of the September 11 attacks, while \"Nasty Girl\" was released only overseas and achieved moderate success. The album was further promoted with the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour (2001) and the Destiny's Child World Tour (2002). After the latter's conclusion, the group embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released a solo studio album to varying levels of success.\n\n",
            "Destiny's Child | Destiny's Child was an American girl group whose final lineup comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. The group began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas. After years of limited success, the original quartet comprising Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. \nThe group was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of the song \"No, No, No\" and their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Say My Name\", alongside successful singles \"Bug a Boo\" and \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles due to favoritism of Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland. In early 2000, both Roberson and Luckett were replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, Franklin quit after a few months, leaving the group as a trio. \nDestiny's Child's third album, Survivor (2001), whose themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, produced the U.S. number-one songs \"Independent Women\" and \"Bootylicious\", as well as \"Survivor\", which peaked at number two. After releasing a Christmas album titled 8 Days of Christmas (2001), Destiny's Child announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers. The trio reunited two years later for the release of their fifth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004), which spawned the U.S. top-three singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\". Since the group's official disbandment in 2006, Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Williams have reunited several times, including at the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show, the 2018 Coachella festival and the final show of the 2025 Cowboy Carter Tour.\nDestiny's Child has sold more than 60 million records as of 2013, making them one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Billboard ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time, the ninth-most successful artist/band of the 2000s, and placed the group 68th in its All-Time Hot 100 Artists list in 2008. In December 2016, the magazine ranked Destiny's Child as the 90th most-successful dance club artist of all time. The group has 14 Grammy Awards nominations, winning twice for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and once for Best R&B Song.\n\n",

Four singles were produced\u2014\u201cBills, Bills, Bills\u201d, \u201cBug a Boo\u201d, \u201cSay My Name\u201d and \u201cJumpin', Jumpin'\u201d. \u201cBills, Bills, Bills\u201d and \u201cSay My Name\u201d became Destiny's Child's first two US Billboard Hot 100 number-ones, with the latter winning the group their first two Grammy Awards. With worldwide sales of 13 million copies, The Writing's on the Wall is one of the best selling albums by a girl group and best-selling R&B albums of all time.\\nThe Writing's on the Wall was largely overshadowed by the controversy surrounding its promotional cycle as a result of the group's internal conflicts. The music video for \u201cSay My Name\u201d saw original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson\u2013who had attempted to split with their manager Mathew Knowles\u2013unexpectedly replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against Knowles and former bandmates, and Franklin departed from Destiny's Child a mere five months after joining, leaving it as a trio. Regardless of the turmoil, a multitude of publications has listed the album among the best records of its time and genre, noting the immense influence on numerous artists.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abSurvivor (Destiny's Child album) , 2001, by Columbia Records. As their breakthrough second studio album The Writing's on the Wall (1999) became a rising commercial success, Destiny's Child faced the controversial departure of original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who were replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams, in February 2000. Soon afterwards, they commenced production of their third studio album, tentatively titled Independent Women.\\nMere five months after joining, Franklin departed from the group in July 2000, and \\\"Independent Women Part I\\\" was subsequently released as a single from the accompanying soundtrack for the film Charlie's Angels (2000). The song became a global commercial success and the group's third US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single. Retitling the album Survivor in reference to the turmoil surrounding their line-up alterations, Destiny's Child enlisted producers such as Anthony Dent, Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari and Keybeats alongside Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, who produced all and co-wrote nearly all of the album's tracks. Their final product was an R&B and pop record incorporating genres such as dance, funk and hip hop. Its lyrical themes explore dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.\\nUpon its release, Survivor received generally positive reviews, mostly aimed at its production, while its balladry, length and lyrical content ignited criticism. Retrospective critical commentaries have credited the record for its impact on mainstream music of the 2000s and for serving as foundation for Knowles' eventual solo career. A global commercial success, the album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 units, becoming Destiny's Child's first and only number-one studio album on the chart. It has gone on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), the album was nominated for Best R&B Album. By 2004, it had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, being among the best-selling girl group albums of all time.\\nSurvivor produced four singles. Its title track peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top ten in 18 additional countries. In 2002, it won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \\\"Bootylicious\\\" became Destiny's Child's fourth US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single and attained international success. \\\"Emotion\\\" became a US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit in the wake of the September 11 attacks, while \\\"Nasty Girl\\\" was released only overseas and achieved moderate success. The album was further promoted with the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour (2001) and the Destiny's Child World Tour (2002). After the latter's conclusion, the group embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released a solo studio album to varying levels of success.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abDestiny's Child , Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. The group began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas. After years of limited success, the original quartet comprising Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. \\nThe group was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of the song \\\"No, No, No\\\" and their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \u201cBills, Bills, Bills\u201d and \u201cSay My Name\u201d, alongside successful singles \u201cBug a Boo\u201d and \u201cJumpin', Jumpin'\u201d. Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles due to favoritism of Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland. In early 2000, both Roberson and Luckett were replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, Franklin quit after a few months, leaving the group as a trio. \\nDestiny's Child's third album, Survivor (2001), whose themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, produced the U.S. number-one songs \\\"Independent Women\\\" and \\\"Bootylicious\\\", as well as \\\"Survivor\\\", which peaked at number two. After releasing a Christmas album titled 8 Days of Christmas (2001), Destiny's Child announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers. The trio reunited two years later for the release of their fifth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004), which spawned the U.S. top-three singles \u201cLose My Breath\u201d and \u201cSoldier\u201d. Since the group's official disbandment in 2006, Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Williams have reunited several times, including at the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show, the 2018 Coachella festival and the final show of the 2025 Cowboy Carter Tour.\\nDestiny's Child has sold more than 60 million records as of 2013, making them one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Billboard ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time, the ninth-most successful artist/band of the 2000s, and placed the group 68th in its All-Time Hot 100 Artists list in 2008. In December 2016, the magazine ranked Destiny's Child as the 90th most-successful dance club artist of all time. The group has 14 Grammy Awards nominations, winning twice for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and once for Best R&B Song.\\n\\n\u00bb\\n[5] \u00ab{'snippet': 'List of songs recorded by Destiny \\'s Child This is a chronological list of officially released and leaked songs by the American R&B-Pop group Destiny \\'s Child .

The sea dogs were able to defeat the Spanish armada in a huge storm because their ships were smaller, faster, and more man\u0153uvrable.   "

After prison guards reportedly performed CPR, he was transported in cardiac arrest to the New York Downtown Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:39 am. The New York City medical examiner and the Justice Department Inspector General ruled that Epstein's death was a suicide by hanging. Epstein's lawyers challenged the medical examiner's conclusion and opened their own investigation, hiring pathologist Michael Baden.\nAfter initially expressing suspicion, Attorney General William Barr described Epstein's death as \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\". Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice's Inspector General conducted investigations into the circumstances of his death. The guards on duty were later charged with multiple counts of record falsification. Many public figures accused the Federal Bureau of Prisons of negligence; several lawmakers called for reforms to the federal prison system. In response, Barr removed the Bureau's director.\nAs a result of Epstein's death, all charges against him were dismissed, and ongoing sex-trafficking investigations shifted attention to his alleged associates, notably Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested and indicted in July 2020 and convicted on five sex trafficking-related counts on December 29, 2021. Another associate, Jean-Luc Brunel, was arrested by French authorities in 2020 and later died by suicide.\nDue to violations of normal jail procedures on the night of Epstein's death, the malfunction of two cameras in front of his cell, and his claims to have compromising information about powerful figures, his death generated speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered.

It is known for its Dairy Milk chocolate, the Creme Egg and Roses selection box, and many other confectionery products. One of the best-known British brands, in 2013 The Daily Telegraph named Cadbury among Britain's most successful exports.\nCadbury was founded in 1824 in Birmingham, England, by John Cadbury (1801\u20131889), a Quaker who sold tea, coffee and drinking chocolate. Cadbury developed the business with his brother Benjamin, followed by his sons Richard and George. George developed the Bournville estate, a model village designed to give the company's workers improved living conditions. Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced by George Jr in 1905, used a higher proportion of milk in the recipe than rival products. By 1914, it was the company's best-selling product. Successive members of the Cadbury family have made innovations with chocolate products. Cadbury, Rowntree's and Fry's were the big three British confectionery manufacturers throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nCadbury was granted its first royal warrant from Queen Victoria in 1854. It held a royal warrant from Elizabeth II from 1955 to 2022. Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry & Sons in 1919, and Schweppes in 1969, known as Cadbury Schweppes until 2008, when the American beverage business was split as Dr Pepper Snapple Group; the rights ownership of the Schweppes brand had already differed between various countries since 2006. In 1992, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the company for 24 years, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world. Cadbury was a constant constituent of the FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange from the index's 1984 inception until the company was bought by Kraft Foods Inc. in 2010.",

In November 2017, The Ferrero Group announced that they were going to acquire the company, which was finalized in December 2017.\nIn 2018, Ferrara's parent company Ferrero SpA purchased Nestl\u00e9's U.S. candy line for $2.8 billion and handed responsibility for most products to Ferrara. Former Nestl\u00e9 products now distributed in the U.S. by Ferrara include Butterfinger, Crunch, Baby Ruth, Raisinets, Nips, Laffy Taffy, and hard candy (such as Spree and Everlasting Gobstopper) formerly produced by Nestl\u00e9 under the Willy Wonka brand.

One of the best-known British brands, in 2013 The Daily Telegraph named Cadbury among Britain's most successful exports.\\nCadbury was founded in 1824 in Birmingham, England, by John Cadbury (1801\u20131889), a Quaker who sold tea, coffee and drinking chocolate. Cadbury developed the business with his brother Benjamin, followed by his sons Richard and George. George developed the Bournville estate, a model village designed to give the company's workers improved living conditions. Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced by George Jr in 1905, used a higher proportion of milk in the recipe than rival products. By 1914, it was the company's best-selling product. Successive members of the Cadbury family have made innovations with chocolate products. Cadbury, Rowntree's and Fry's were the big three British confectionery manufacturers throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries.\\nCadbury was granted its first royal warrant from Queen Victoria in 1854. It held a royal warrant from Elizabeth II from 1955 to 2022. Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry & Sons in 1919, and Schweppes in 1969, known as Cadbury Schweppes until 2008, when the American beverage business was split as Dr Pepper Snapple Group; the rights ownership of the Schweppes brand had already differed between various countries since 2006. In 1992, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the company for 24 years, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world. Cadbury was a constant constituent of the FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange from the index's 1984 inception until the company was bought by Kraft Foods Inc. in 2010.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abFerrara Candy Company , based in downtown Chicago, Illinois, and owned by the Ferrero Group.\\nThe company was formed from a 2012 merger of the Illinois-based Ferrara Pan Candy Company and Minnesota-based Farley's & Sathers Candy Company. Ferrara's product line includes the brands of Ferrara-branded pan candy (such as Lemonheads, Atomic Fireballs, Red Hots, and Original Boston Baked Beans) and those of Farley's & Sathers (such as Brach's, Chuckles, Jujyfruits, and Now and Later). In November 2017, The Ferrero Group announced that they were going to acquire the company, which was finalized in December 2017.\\nIn 2018, Ferrara's parent company Ferrero SpA purchased Nestl\u00e9's U.S. candy line for $2.8 billion and handed responsibility for most products to Ferrara. Former Nestl\u00e9 products now distributed in the U.S. by Ferrara include Butterfinger, Crunch, Baby Ruth, Raisinets, Nips, Laffy Taffy, and hard candy (such as Spree and Everlasting Gobstopper) formerly produced by Nestl\u00e9 under the Willy Wonka brand. Two exceptions are Nestl\u00e9's Kit Kat and Rolo lines, which are licensed to the Hershey Company.\\nFerrara announced it was moving its world headquarters to Chicago in 2019.\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"Who owns green and black's organic chocolate?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": \"DQ 1: Who founded Green & Black's organic chocolate?\\nDA 1: Craig Sams and Josephine Fairley\\nDQ 2: Who currently owns Green & Black's organic chocolate?\\nDA 2: Mondelez International\",\n  \"Answer\": \"Green & Black's organic chocolate was initially founded by Craig Sams and Josephine Fairley in 1991.

It was founded in 1971 during the Troubles by Ian Paisley, who led the party  until 2008. It is currently led by Gavin Robinson, who initially stepped in as an interim after the resignation of Jeffrey Donaldson. It is the second-largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and won five seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the 2024 election. The party has been mostly described as right-wing and socially conservative, being anti-abortion and opposing same-sex marriage. The DUP sees itself as defending Britishness and Ulster Protestant culture against Irish nationalism and republicanism. It is also Eurosceptic and supported Brexit.\nThe DUP evolved from the Protestant Unionist Party and has historically strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the church Paisley founded. During the Troubles, the DUP opposed sharing power with Irish nationalists or republicans as a means of resolving the conflict, and likewise rejected attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs. It campaigned against the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973, the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. In the 1980s, the DUP was involved in setting up the loyalist paramilitary movements Third Force and Ulster Resistance, the latter of which helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland.\nFor the first three decades of the DUP's history, the Ulster Unionist Party was the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland; however, by 2004, the DUP had overtaken the UUP in terms of seats in both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the UK House of Commons. In 2006, the DUP co-signed the St Andrews Agreement and the following year agreed to enter into power-sharing devolved government with Sinn F\u00e9in, who agreed to support the Police Service, courts, and rule of law. Paisley became joint First Minister of Northern Ireland. However, the DUP's only Member of the European Parliament (MEP), Jim Allister, and seven DUP councillors left the party in protest, founding the Traditional Unionist Voice.\nIan Paisley was succeeded as DUP leader and First Minister by Peter Robinson (2008\u20132015), then by Arlene Foster (2015\u20132021). After Foster was ousted, Edwin Poots briefly became leader and nominated Paul Givan as First Minister, but was himself forced to step down after three weeks.

The title for the film is derived from an American antiwar slogan from the hippie subculture during the Vietnam War era, popularized by Charlotte E. Keyes in her 1966 article for McCall's magazine titled \"Suppose They Gave a War and No One Came\". The title for the article came from a quote from a Carl Sandburg poem, which became part of the anti-Vietnam-War lexicon.

First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. A total of 121 World Series have been contested through 2025, with the AL champion winning 68 and the NL champion winning 53. The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 41 World Series, winning 27 \u2013 the most championship appearances and most victories by any MLB team. The Dodgers and the Yankees are tied for the most losses with 14 each. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 championships, the most among NL clubs and second-most all-time behind the Yankees. The Dodgers have represented the NL the most in the World Series with 23 appearances. The Seattle Mariners are the only MLB franchise that has never appeared in a World Series; the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays, and Colorado Rockies have all played in the Series but have never won it, with the Padres and the Rays appearing twice. The Los Angeles Angels and Washington Nationals are the only teams who have won their only World Series appearance, and the Miami Marlins are the only team with multiple World Series appearances and no losses with two. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear in and win a World Series, winning in 1992 and 1993. The Houston Astros are the only franchise to have represented both the NL (2005) and the AL (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022), winning the Series in 2017 and 2022.

As the 105th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff contested between the Philadelphia Phillies, champions of the National League (NL) and defending World Series champions, and the New York Yankees, champions of the American League (AL). The Yankees defeated the Phillies, 4 games to 2, winning their 27th World Series championship. The series was played between October 28 and November 4, broadcast on Fox, and watched by an average of roughly 19 million viewers. Home field advantage for the Series went to the AL for the eighth straight year as a result of its 4\u20133 win in the All-Star Game. The Phillies earned their berth into the playoffs by winning the National League East. The Yankees won the American League East to earn their berth, posting the best record in the Major Leagues. The Phillies reached the World Series by defeating the Colorado Rockies in the best-of-five National League Division Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the best-of-seven NL Championship Series (NLCS). The Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the AL Championship Series (ALCS) to advance to their first World Series since 2003. As a result of their loss, the Phillies became the first team since the 2001 Yankees to lose the World Series after winning it the previous year. The Phillies were also the last defending champions to make the World Series until the 2025 Dodgers. Cliff Lee pitched a complete game in the Phillies' Game 1 victory, allowing only one unearned run, while Chase Utley hit two home runs. In Game 2, solo home runs by Mark Teixeira and Hideki Matsui helped the Yankees win by a score of 3\u20131. After a rain delayed start, Game 3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total runs en route to a Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game 4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert base running play by Johnny Damon. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game 5, aided by Utley's second two\u2013home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time designated hitter to win the award. Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the designated hitter position was not used in NL ballparks at the time.",

The Red Sox defeated the Dodgers in five games to win their fourth World Series title in 15 years dating back to 2004, and their ninth in franchise history. This was the second World Series matchup between the two franchises, after the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins (later known as the Dodgers) in five games in 1916. The series was sponsored by the Internet television service YouTube TV and officially known as the 2018 World Series presented by YouTube TV.\nThe Series was televised in the United States on Fox.

The empire spanned a total area of 3.9 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles) from Anatolia and the Levant in the west to the Hindu Kush in the east, and from Central Asia in the north to the Persian Gulf in the south, and it spanned the time period 1037\u20131308, though Seljuk rule beyond the Anatolian peninsula ended in 1194.\nThe Seljuk Empire was founded in 1037 by Tughril (990\u20131063) and his brother Chaghri (989\u20131060), both of whom co-ruled over its territories; there are indications that the Seljuk leadership otherwise functioned as a triumvirate and thus included Musa Yabghu, the uncle of the aforementioned two.\nDuring the formative phase of the empire, the Seljuks first advanced from their original homelands near the Aral Sea into Khorasan and then into the Iranian mainland, where they would become largely based as a Persianate society. They then moved west to conquer Baghdad, filling up the power vacuum that had been caused by struggles between the Arab Abbasid Caliphate and the Iranian Buyid Empire.\nThe subsequent Seljuk expansion into eastern Anatolia triggered the Byzantine\u2013Seljuk wars, with the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 marking a decisive turning point in the conflict in favour of the Seljuks, undermining the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the remaining parts of Anatolia and gradually enabling the region's Turkification.\nThe Seljuk Empire united the fractured political landscape in the non-Arab eastern parts of the Muslim world and played a key role in both the First and Second Crusades; it also bore witness to in the creation and expansion of multiple artistic movements during this period In 1141, the Seljuk Empire suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Qatwan against the Qara-Khitai (Western Liao), resulting in the loss of its eastern vassal state, the Kara-Khanids, as well as vast eastern territories. This defeat severely weakened the empire, causing internal division and hastening its decline. The Seljuks were eventually supplanted in the east by the Khwarazmian Empire in 1194 and in the west by the Zengids and Ayyubids. The last surviving Seljuk sultanate to fall was the Sultanate of Rum, which fell in 1308.",

Tughril united many Turkoman warriors of the Central Asian steppes into a confederacy of tribes and led them in conquest of Khorasan and eastern Persia. He would later establish the Seljuk Sultanate after conquering Persia and taking the Abbasid capital of Baghdad from the Buyids in 1055. Tughril relegated the Abbasid Caliphs to state figureheads and took command of the caliphate's armies in military offensives against the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimids in an effort to expand his empire's borders and unite the Islamic world. After the deaths of Seljuk leaders such as Israil and Mikail, the Seljuks submitted to the authority of Tughril Bey and began expanding their territories under the leadership of his brother, Chaghri Beg. In 1037, Tughril was declared sultan by the prominent figures of the Seljuk dynasty, and a sermon (khutbah) was delivered in his name. Following the death of Mahmud of Ghazni and the accession of Sultan Mas\u02bdud, the Seljuks, under Tughril\u2019s leadership, engaged in several phases of warfare with the Ghaznavids. As a result, the Seljuks emerged as a new power in the Middle East after their decisive victory in the Battle of Dandanqan in 1040, which brought an end to Ghaznavid rule in Greater Khorasan and surrounding regions. Subsequently, Tughril settled in Nishapur as his capital and, with the support of his brother and close allies, established his own state. Following the Battle of Dandanaqan, Tughril, along with the Seljuk leadership, sent a letter to the Abbasid caliph al-Qa'im bi-Amrillah, requesting an official decree of authority, which was granted. Between the Hijri years 1040\u20131054, with the assistance of Ibrahim Inal, Tughril conquered large parts of Iranian territory, including the regions of Jibal and Iraq-i Ajam, and brought an end to the Buyid government in these areas. He captured the city of Ray, restored it, and declared it the capital. However, after capturing Isfahan, he moved the capital there. Later, Tughril brought Azerbaijan under his control and carried out military campaigns against Byzantium and other regions of Eastern Roman territories, further expanding the Seljuk realm. In 1055, accepting an invitation from the Abbasid caliph to visit Baghdad, Tughril initiated a new phase in Seljuk\u2013Abbasid relations. Between 1055\u20131061, he eliminated Buyid rule in Baghdad, captured Malik Rahim, and had sermons read in his name in those territories. After restoring Baghdad, Tughril arranged the marriage of Chaghri Beg\u2019s daughter to the Abbasid caliph, thus strengthening ties with the caliphate. He subsequently seized the Jazira region. Later, after suppressing a revolt by his brother Ibrahim Inal and executing him, Tughril also defeated Arslan al-Basasiri, who had the backing of the Fatimid Caliphate. He married the caliph\u2019s daughter despite opposition from the caliph himself\u2014a union that was accompanied by numerous challenges."

Super Mario Bros. was first released in Japan on September 13, 1985, for the Family Computer. It was released later that year in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its exact North American release date is unknown and is frequently debated; though generally being cited as having been released alongside the NES in October 1985 as a launch game, several other sources conflict with this statement, suggesting that the game may have released in other varying time frames ranging from November 1985 to early 1986. The game was released in Europe two years later on May 15, 1987 for the NES, and the Australian release was later that year in 1987."

Board of Education originated in 1951, when the public school district in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll the daughter of local black resident Oliver Brown at the school closest to their home, instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black elementary school farther away. The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations then filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education, alleging that its segregation policy was unconstitutional. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Court's unanimous (9\u20130) decision stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\", and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution."

            "UEFA Champions League | The UEFA Champions League (UCL), usually known simply as the Champions League, is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup (French: Coupe des Clubs Champions Europ\u00e9ens), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997\u201398 season. While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default, with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season. Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League. In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June. The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins), Italy (12 wins), Germany (8 wins), Netherlands (6 wins) and Portugal (4 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 24 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once. Since the tournament changed name and structure in 1992, only two top-tier football clubs outside the Big Five European nations (Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France) have also reached the final: Porto (2003\u201304) and Ajax (1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396). Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions)."

The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup (French: Coupe des Clubs Champions Europ\u00e9ens), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997\u201398 season. While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default, with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season. Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League. In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June. The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins), Italy (12 wins), Germany (8 wins), Netherlands (6 wins) and Portugal (4 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 24 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once. Since the tournament changed name and structure in 1992, only two top-tier football clubs outside the Big Five European nations (Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France) have also reached the final: Porto (2003\u201304) and Ajax (1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396). Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"When does the champions league group stage start?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": {\n    \"DQ 1\": \"When did the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League group stage start?\",\n    \"DA 1\": \"September 14, 2021\",\n    \"DQ 2\": \"When will the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League league phase start?\",\n    \"DA 2\": \"September 17, 2024\",\n    \"DQ 3\": \"When will the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League league phase start?\",\n    \"DA 3\": \"September 16, 2025\"\n  },\n  \"Answer\": \"The Champions League group stage occurs annually, so the answer depends on the year in question.

Super Mario Bros. is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, with praise for its precise controls. It is one of the best-selling games of all time, with more than 50 million copies sold worldwide. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the 1983 crash, and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. Super Mario Bros. was first released in Japan on September 13, 1985, for the Family Computer. It was released later that year in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its exact North American release date is unknown and is frequently debated; though generally being cited as having been released alongside the NES in October 1985 as a launch game, several other sources conflict with this statement, suggesting that the game may have released in other varying time frames ranging from November 1985 to early 1986. The game was released in Europe two years later on May 15, 1987 for the NES, and the Australian release was later that year in 1987."

            "Gold standard | A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. The gold standard was the basis for the international monetary system from the 1870s to the early 1920s, and from the late 1920s to 1932 as well as from 1944 until 1971 when the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US dollar to gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system. Many states nonetheless hold substantial gold reserves.\nHistorically, the silver standard and bimetallism have been more common than the gold standard. The shift to an international monetary system based on a gold standard reflected accident, network externalities, and path dependence.

The gold standard was abandoned due to its propensity for volatility, as well as the constraints it imposed on governments: by retaining a fixed exchange rate, governments were hamstrung in engaging in expansionary policies to, for example, reduce unemployment during economic recessions.\nAccording to a 2012 survey of 39 economists, the vast majority (92 percent) agreed that a return to the gold standard would not improve price-stability and employment outcomes, and two-thirds of economic historians surveyed in the mid-1990s rejected the idea that the gold standard \"was effective in stabilizing prices and moderating business-cycle fluctuations during the nineteenth century.\" The consensus view among economists is that the gold standard helped prolong and deepen the Great Depression. Historically, banking crises were more common during periods under the gold standard, while currency crises were less common. According to economist Michael D.

            "Lakota religion | Lakota religion or Lakota spirituality is the traditional Native American religion of the Lakota people. It is practiced primarily in the North American Great Plains, within Lakota communities on reservations in North Dakota and South Dakota. The tradition has no formal leadership or organizational structure and displays much internal variation.\nCentral to Lakota religion is the concept of wak\u02bd\u0105, an energy or power permeating the universe. The unified totality of wak\u02bd\u0105 is termed Wak\u02bd\u0105 T\u02bd\u0105k\u0105 and is regarded as the source of all things. Lakota religionists believe that, due to their shared possession of wak\u02bd\u0105, humans exist in a state of kinship with all life forms, a relationship that informs adherents' behavior. The Lakota worldview includes various supernatural wak\u02bd\u0105 beings, the wak\u02bd\u0105pi, who may be benevolent or malevolent towards humanity. Prayers are given to the wak\u02bd\u0105pi to secure their assistance, often facilitated through the smoking of a sacred pipe or the provision of offerings, usually cotton flags or tobacco. Various rituals are important to Lakota life, seven of them presented as having been given by a benevolent wak\u02bd\u0105 spirit, White Buffalo Calf Woman. These include the sweat lodge purification ceremony, the vision quest, and the sun dance. A ritual specialist, usually called a wi\u010dh\u00e1\u0161a wakh\u00e1 (\"holy man\"), is responsible for healing and other tasks. The most common of these specialists is the yuw\u00edpi wi\u010dh\u00e1\u0161a (yuw\u00edpi man), whose yuw\u00edpi ritual typically invokes spirits for healing.\nOne of the three main populations speaking a Sioux language, the Lakota had emerged as a distinct nation composed of seven groups by the 19th century. Many of their religious traditions reflected commonalities with those of other Sioux nations as well as non-Sioux communities like the Cheyenne. In the 1860s and 1870s, the United States government relocated most of the Lakota to the Great Sioux Reservation, where concerted efforts were made to convert them to Christianity. Most Lakota ultimately converted, although many also continued to practice certain Lakota traditions. The U.S. government also implemented measures to suppress traditional rites, for instance banning the sun dance in 1883, although traditional perspectives were documented in the 19th and early 20th centuries by practitioners like Black Elk. Encouraged by the American Indian Movement, the 1960s and 1970s saw revitalization efforts to revive Lakota traditional religion. In the late 20th century, Lakota practices increasingly influenced other Native American religions across North America.\nMany Lakota practice their traditional religion alongside Christianity, typically Catholicism, Episcopalianism, or the peyote religion of the Native American Church.  For these individuals, Wak\u02bd\u0105 T\u02bd\u0105k\u0105 is often identified with the Christian God. Lakota traditions have also been adopted by many non-Native Americans, especially New Agers, a tendency condemned by some Lakota spokespeople as cultural appropriation."

            "Land | Land, also known as dry land, ground, or earth, is the solid terrestrial surface of Earth not submerged by the ocean or another body of water. It makes up 29.2% of Earth's surface and includes all continents and islands. Earth's land surface is almost entirely covered by regolith, a layer of rock, soil, and minerals that forms the outer part of the crust. Land plays an important role in Earth's climate system, being involved in the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and water cycle. One-third of land is covered in trees, another third is used for agriculture, and one-tenth is covered in permanent snow and glaciers. The remainder consists of desert, savannah, and prairie.\nLand terrain varies greatly, consisting of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, glaciers, and other landforms. In physical geology, the land is divided into two major categories: Mountain ranges and relatively flat interiors called cratons. Both form over millions of years through plate tectonics. Streams \u2013 a major part of Earth's water cycle \u2013 shape the landscape, carve rocks, transport sediments, and replenish groundwater. At high elevations or latitudes, snow is compacted and recrystallized over hundreds or thousands of years to form glaciers, which can be so heavy that they warp the Earth's crust. About 30 percent of land has a dry climate, due to losing more water through evaporation than it gains from precipitation. Since warm air rises, this generates winds, though Earth's rotation and uneven sun distribution also play a part.\nLand is commonly defined as the solid, dry surface of Earth. It can also refer to the collective natural resources that the land holds, including rivers, lakes, and the biosphere. Human manipulation of the land, including agriculture and architecture, can also be considered part of land. Land is formed from the continental crust, the layer of rock on which soil, groundwater, and human and other animal activity sits.\nThough modern terrestrial plants and animals evolved from aquatic creatures, Earth's first cellular life likely originated on land. Survival on land relies on fresh water from rivers, streams, lakes, and glaciers, which constitute only three percent of the water on Earth. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in habitable land areas supporting agriculture and various natural resources. In recent decades, scientists and policymakers have emphasized the need to manage land and its biosphere more sustainably, through measures such as restoring degraded soil, preserving biodiversity, protecting endangered species, and addressing climate change.",

            "The Lion King (2019 film) | The Lion King is a 2019 American musical drama film that is a photorealistically animated remake of the traditionally-animated 1994 film. Directed by Jon Favreau, written by Jeff Nathanson, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Fairview Entertainment, the film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Florence Kasumba, Eric Andr\u00e9, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph, with Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, and James Earl Jones (reprising his voice role as Mufasa for the final time). The plot follows a young lion, Simba, who flees his kingdom when his father, Mufasa, is murdered by his uncle, Scar. After growing up in exile, Simba returns home to confront his uncle and reclaim his throne.\nPlans for a remake of 1994's The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following box office successes for Disney remakes such as The Jungle Book (2016). Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed on in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The virtual reality tools utilized in The Jungle Book's cinematography were used to a greater degree during the filming of The Lion King. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, \"Spirit\", which she also performed.

It was held from 9 June to 9 July 2006 in Germany, which had won the right to host the event in July 2000. Teams representing 198 national football associations from all six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began in September 2003. Thirty-one teams qualified from this process along with hosts Germany for the finals tournament. It was the second time that Germany staged the competition and the first as a unified country along with the former East Germany with Leipzig as a host city (the other was in 1974 in West Germany), and the 10th time that the tournament was held in Europe.\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5\u20133 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1\u20131 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3\u20131 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\nBrazil were the defending world champions, but were eliminated by France in the quarter-finals.\nThe 2006 World Cup stands as one of the most watched events in television history, garnering an estimated 26.29 billion times viewed compiled over the course of the tournament.

The match was played at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, on 9 July 2006, and was contested between Italy and France. The event comprised hosts Germany and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Italy finished first in Group E, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Australia in the round of 16, Ukraine in the quarter-final and Germany 2\u20130, in the semi-final. France finished runner-up of Group G with one win and two draws, before defeating Spain in the round of 16, Brazil in the quarter-final and Portugal 1\u20130 in the semi-final.

The match was focused mostly on France's Zinedine Zidane and Italy's Marco Materazzi: this was the last match of Zidane's career; they each scored their team's only goal of the game; and they were also involved in an incident in extra time that led to Zidane being sent off for head-butting Materazzi in the chest. The incident was the subject of much analysis following the match. Italy's Andrea Pirlo was named the man of the match, and Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament.\nThe final served as a key match in the France\u2013Italy football rivalry, coming after Italy were defeated by France in the UEFA Euro 2000 final. Italy's victory was their first world title in 24 years, and their fourth overall, putting them one ahead of Germany and only one behind Brazil. The victory also led to Italy topping the FIFA World Rankings in February 2007 for the first time since November 1993. Italy's manager Marcello Lippi said after the game that \"It takes a lot of determination and a lot of conviction in penalty shootouts \u2013 it's not by chance. Our boys really wanted it and that's why they were able to put away all five\" while France manager Raymond Domenech defended Zidane and lamented the loss, saying \"I am deeply disappointed. We deserved the title based over the whole match\".\nBoth sides would fail to get past the group stage of the 2010 tournament, becoming the first set of finalists to do so, while Italy became the third World Cup champions to be eliminated from the group phase after Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002.",

It was held from 9 June to 9 July 2006 in Germany, which had won the right to host the event in July 2000. Teams representing 198 national football associations from all six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began in September 2003. Thirty-one teams qualified from this process along with hosts Germany for the finals tournament. It was the second time that Germany staged the competition and the first as a unified country along with the former East Germany with Leipzig as a host city (the other was in 1974 in West Germany), and the 10th time that the tournament was held in Europe.\\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5\u20133 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1\u20131 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3\u20131 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\\nBrazil were the defending world champions, but were eliminated by France in the quarter-finals.\\nThe 2006 World Cup stands as one of the most watched events in television history, garnering an estimated 26.29 billion times viewed compiled over the course of the tournament.

The match was played at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, on 9 July 2006, and was contested between Italy and France. The event comprised hosts Germany and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Italy finished first in Group E, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Australia in the round of 16, Ukraine in the quarter-final and Germany 2\u20130, in the semi-final. France finished runner-up of Group G with one win and two draws, before defeating Spain in the round of 16, Brazil in the quarter-final and Portugal 1\u20130 in the semi-final. The final was witnessed by 69,000 spectators in the stadium, with the referee for the match being Horacio Elizondo from Argentina.\\nItaly won the World Cup after beating France 5\u20133 in a penalty shoot-out following a 1\u20131 draw at the conclusion of extra time. The match was focused mostly on France's Zinedine Zidane and Italy's Marco Materazzi: this was the last match of Zidane's career; they each scored their team's only goal of the game; and they were also involved in an incident in extra time that led to Zidane being sent off for head-butting Materazzi in the chest. The incident was the subject of much analysis following the match. Italy's Andrea Pirlo was named the man of the match, and Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament.\\nThe final served as a key match in the France\u2013Italy football rivalry, coming after Italy were defeated by France in the UEFA Euro 2000 final. Italy's victory was their first world title in 24 years, and their fourth overall, putting them one ahead of Germany and only one behind Brazil. The victory also led to Italy topping the FIFA World Rankings in February 2007 for the first time since November 1993. Italy's manager Marcello Lippi said after the game that \\\"It takes a lot of determination and a lot of conviction in penalty shootouts \u2013 it's not by chance. Our boys really wanted it and that's why they were able to put away all five\\\" while France manager Raymond Domenech defended Zidane and lamented the loss, saying \\\"I am deeply disappointed. We deserved the title based over the whole match\\\".\\nBoth sides would fail to get past the group stage of the 2010 tournament, becoming the first set of finalists to do so, while Italy became the third World Cup champions to be eliminated from the group phase after Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00ab{'snippet': 'The World Cup final is the last match of the competition, played by the only two teams remaining in contention, and the result determines which country is declared the world champion.

            "Composition of the Torah | The composition of the Torah (or Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible\u2014Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) was a process that involved multiple authors over an extended period of time. \nJewish tradition held that all five books were originally written by Moses in the 2nd millennium BCE, but since the 17th century modern scholars have rejected Mosaic authorship. The precise process by which the Torah was composed, the number of authors involved, and the date of each author remain hotly contested. Some scholars, such as Rolf Rendtorff, espouse a fragmentary hypothesis, in which the Pentateuch is seen as a compilation of short, independent narratives, which were gradually brought together into larger units in two editorial phases: the Deuteronomic and the Priestly phases. By contrast, scholars such as John Van Seters advocate a supplementary hypothesis, which posits that the Torah is the result of two major additions\u2014Yahwist and Priestly\u2014to an existing corpus of work. Other scholars, such as Richard Elliott Friedman or Joel S. Baden, support a revised version of the documentary hypothesis, holding that the Torah was composed by using four different sources\u2014Yahwist, Elohist, Priestly, and Deuteronomist\u2014that were combined into one in the Persian period in Yehud.\nScholars frequently use these newer hypotheses in combination, making it challenging to classify contemporary theories as strictly one or another. The general trend in recent scholarship is to recognize the final form of the Torah as a literary and ideological unity, based on earlier sources, was likely completed during the Persian period (539\u2013333 BCE).",

            "Three Kingdoms | The Three Kingdoms of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu dominated China from AD 220 to 280 following the end of the Han dynasty. This period was preceded by the Eastern Han dynasty and followed by the Western Jin dynasty. Academically, the periodisation begins with the establishment of Cao Wei in 220 and ends with the conquest of Wu by Jin in 280. The period immediately preceding the Three Kingdoms, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting among warlords across China as Han authority collapsed. The period from 220 to 263 was marked by a comparatively stable arrangement between Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. This stability broke down with the conquest of Shu by Wei in 263, followed by the usurpation of Cao Wei by Jin in 266 and ultimately the conquest of Wu by Jin in 280.\nThe Three Kingdoms period including the collapse of the Han was one of the most dangerous in Chinese history due to multiple plagues, widespread famines, and civil war. A nationwide census taken in 280, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin showed a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era. While the census may not have been particularly accurate due to a multitude of factors of the times, in 280, the Jin did make an attempt to account for all individuals where they could.\nTechnology advanced significantly during this period. Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang invented the wooden ox, suggested to be an early form of the wheelbarrow, and improved on the repeating crossbow. Wei mechanical engineer Ma Jun is considered by many to be the equal of his predecessor Zhang Heng. He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed for Emperor Ming of Wei, square-pallet chain pumps for irrigation of gardens in Luoyang, and the ingenious design of the south-pointing chariot, a non-magnetic directional compass operated by differential gears.\nThe authoritative historical record of the era is Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms (c.\u2009290 AD), in tandem with the later annotations published in 429 by Pei Songzhi. While comparatively short, the Three Kingdoms period has been romanticised in the culture of the Sinosphere. It has been retold and dramatised in folklore, opera, and novels, as well as film, television, and video games. The most well-known fictional adaptation of the history is Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a historical novel written during the Ming dynasty by Luo Guanzhong.",
            "List of Chinese inventions | China has been the source of many innovations, scientific discoveries and inventions. This includes the Four Great Inventions: papermaking, the compass, gunpowder, and early printing (both woodblock and movable type). The list below contains these and other inventions in ancient and modern China attested by archaeological or historical evidence, including prehistoric inventions of Neolithic and early Bronze Age China.\nThe historical region now known as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. Use of the plow during the Neolithic period Longshan culture (c. 3000 \u2013 c. 2000 BC) allowed for high agricultural production yields and rise of Chinese civilization during the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1050 BC). Later inventions such as the multiple-tube seed drill and the heavy moldboard iron plow enabled China to sustain a much larger population through improvements in agricultural output.\nBy the Warring States period (403\u2013221 BC), inhabitants of China had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, and the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). The invention of gunpowder in the mid 9th century during the Tang dynasty led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. Differential gears were utilized in the south-pointing chariot for terrestrial navigation by the 3rd century during the Three Kingdoms. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.\nFor the purposes of this list, inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in China, and as such does not include foreign technologies which the Chinese acquired through contact, such as the windmill from the Middle East or the telescope from early modern Europe. It also does not include technologies developed elsewhere and later invented separately by the Chinese, such as the odometer, water wheel, and chain pump. Scientific, mathematical or natural discoveries made by the Chinese, changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on the list.\n\n"

This period was preceded by the Eastern Han dynasty and followed by the Western Jin dynasty. Academically, the periodisation begins with the establishment of Cao Wei in 220 and ends with the conquest of Wu by Jin in 280. The period immediately preceding the Three Kingdoms, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting among warlords across China as Han authority collapsed. The period from 220 to 263 was marked by a comparatively stable arrangement between Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. This stability broke down with the conquest of Shu by Wei in 263, followed by the usurpation of Cao Wei by Jin in 266 and ultimately the conquest of Wu by Jin in 280.\\nThe Three Kingdoms period including the collapse of the Han was one of the most dangerous in Chinese history due to multiple plagues, widespread famines, and civil war. A nationwide census taken in 280, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin showed a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era. While the census may not have been particularly accurate due to a multitude of factors of the times, in 280, the Jin did make an attempt to account for all individuals where they could.\\nTechnology advanced significantly during this period. Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang invented the wooden ox, suggested to be an early form of the wheelbarrow, and improved on the repeating crossbow. Wei mechanical engineer Ma Jun is considered by many to be the equal of his predecessor Zhang Heng. He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed for Emperor Ming of Wei, square-pallet chain pumps for irrigation of gardens in Luoyang, and the ingenious design of the south-pointing chariot, a non-magnetic directional compass operated by differential gears.\\nThe authoritative historical record of the era is Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms (c.\\u2009290 AD), in tandem with the later annotations published in 429 by Pei Songzhi. While comparatively short, the Three Kingdoms period has been romanticised in the culture of the Sinosphere. It has been retold and dramatised in folklore, opera, and novels, as well as film, television, and video games. The most well-known fictional adaptation of the history is Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a historical novel written during the Ming dynasty by Luo Guanzhong.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abList of Chinese inventions , scientific discoveries and inventions. This includes the Four Great Inventions: papermaking, the compass, gunpowder, and early printing (both woodblock and movable type). The list below contains these and other inventions in ancient and modern China attested by archaeological or historical evidence, including prehistoric inventions of Neolithic and early Bronze Age China.\\nThe historical region now known as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. Use of the plow during the Neolithic period Longshan culture (c. 3000 \u2013 c. 2000 BC) allowed for high agricultural production yields and rise of Chinese civilization during the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1050 BC). Later inventions such as the multiple-tube seed drill and the heavy moldboard iron plow enabled China to sustain a much larger population through improvements in agricultural output.\\nBy the Warring States period (403\u2013221 BC), inhabitants of China had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, and the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). The invention of gunpowder in the mid 9th century during the Tang dynasty led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. Differential gears were utilized in the south-pointing chariot for terrestrial navigation by the 3rd century during the Three Kingdoms. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.\\nFor the purposes of this list, inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in China, and as such does not include foreign technologies which the Chinese acquired through contact, such as the windmill from the Middle East or the telescope from early modern Europe. It also does not include technologies developed elsewhere and later invented separately by the Chinese, such as the odometer, water wheel, and chain pump. Scientific, mathematical or natural discoveries made by the Chinese, changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on the list.\\n\\n\",\n\"Question\": \"When did the ancient chinese civilization begin and end?\",\n\"Disambiguations\": {\n\"DQ 1\": \"When did the ancient chinese civilization begin?\",\n\"DA 1\": \"Around 2070 B.C.\";\n\"DQ 2\": \"When did the ancient chinese civilization end?\",\n\"DA 2\": \"Approximately 256 B.C.\"\n},\n\"Answer\": \"Ancient China began around 2070 B.C. and extended until approximately 256 B.C.

The castle was founded after the Norman Conquest of 1066; with development through to the Tudor period. It has been described by the architectural historian Anthony Emery as \"the finest surviving example of a semi-royal palace of the later Middle Ages, significant for its scale, form and quality of workmanship\". \nKenilworth played an important historical role: it was the subject of the six-month-long siege of Kenilworth in 1266, thought to be the longest siege in medieval English history, and formed a base for Lancastrian operations in the Wars of the Roses. Kenilworth was the scene of the removal of Edward II from the English throne, the perceived French insult to Henry V in 1414 of a gift of tennis balls (said by John Strecche to have prompted the campaign that led to the Battle of Agincourt), and the Earl of Leicester's lavish reception of Elizabeth I in 1575. It has been described as \"one of two major castles [with Caerphilly Castle] in Britain which may be classified as water-castles or lake-fortresses...\".\nThe castle was built over several centuries. Founded in the 1120s around a powerful Norman great tower, the castle was significantly enlarged by King John at the beginning of the 13th century. Huge water defences were created by damming the local streams, and the resulting fortifications proved able to withstand assaults by land and water in 1266. John of Gaunt spent lavishly in the late 14th century, turning the medieval castle into a palace fortress designed in the latest perpendicular style. The Earl of Leicester then expanded the castle during his tenure in the 16th century, constructing new Tudor buildings and exploiting the medieval heritage of Kenilworth to produce a fashionable Renaissance palace.\n\n",

            "Lorraine Hansberry | Lorraine Vivian Hansberry (May 19, 1930 \u2013 January 12, 1965) was an American playwright and writer. She was the first Black American female author to have a play performed on Broadway. Her best-known work, the play A Raisin in the Sun, highlights the lives of Black Americans in Chicago living under racial segregation. The title of the play was taken from the poem \"Harlem\" by Langston Hughes: \"What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?\" At the age of 29, she won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award \u2013 making her the first Black American dramatist, the fifth woman, and the youngest playwright to do so. Hansberry's family had struggled against segregation, challenging a restrictive covenant in the 1940 U.S. Supreme Court case Hansberry v. Lee.\nAfter she moved to New York City, Hansberry worked at the Pan-Africanist newspaper Freedom, where she worked with other Black intellectuals such as Paul Robeson and W. E. B. Du Bois. Much of her work during this time concerned the African struggles for liberation and their impact on the world. Hansberry also wrote about being a lesbian and the oppression of gay people. She died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 34 during the Broadway run of her play The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window in 1965. Hansberry inspired the Nina Simone song \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\", whose title-line came from Hansberry's autobiographical play.\n\n",

The film's director, Michael Mann  initially asked Jones to provide an electronic score for the film. However, late in the game, it was decided an orchestral score would be more appropriate for this historic epic film. Jones hurried to re-fashion the score for an orchestra in the limited time left. Additionally, the constant re-cutting of the film meant music cues sometimes had to be rewritten several times to keep up with the new timings. Finally, with the release date looming, composer Randy Edelman was called-in to score some minor scenes which Jones did not have time to do. Jones and Edelman received co-credit on the film, thus making this very popular and acclaimed score ineligible for Oscar consideration. Although all were displeased with the circumstances, Jones was not fired from the film despite reports to the contrary."

            "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege | Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a 2015 tactical shooter game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, or taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but features offline training modes that can be played solo.\nSiege is an entry in the Rainbow Six series and the successor to Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. After Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, Ubisoft decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated the core of the Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units and looked at real-life examples of sieges such as the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in December 2015, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in December 2020, and Google Stadia in June 2021.\nThe game received an overall positive reception from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the game's player base increased significantly as Ubisoft adopted a \"games as a service\" model for the game and subsequently released several packages of free downloadable content. Several years after the game's release, some critics regarded Siege as one of the best multiplayer games in the modern market due to the improvements brought by the post-launch updates. The company partnered with ESL to make Siege an esports game. In December 2020, the game surpassed 70 million registered players across all platforms. Rainbow Six Extraction, a spin-off game featuring Siege characters, was released in January 2022.",
            "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game) | Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is a 1998 tactical shooter video game developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, with later ports for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Mac OS, Game Boy Color, and Dreamcast. It is the first installment in the Rainbow Six series. Based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same name, the game follows Rainbow, a top secret international counterterrorist organization, and the conspiracy they unravel as they handle a seemingly random spike in terrorism.\nIn singleplayer, the player advances through a series of missions in a campaign. Before each mission, the player is briefed on the situation, selects and organizes their operatives and equipment, and plans their movement through the level; during missions, the player controls an operative leading computer-controlled teammates as they follow the player's plan. In multiplayer, players cooperate in player versus environment missions or battle to complete objectives in player versus player matches. The game features realistic gameplay factors, weapon lethality, and consequences for failure, forcing players to plan their approach carefully and promoting replayability for more streamlined completion.\nRainbow Six began as a concept by Red Storm following their formation in 1996. The game was developed in parallel with the Rainbow Six novel, with a design philosophy of realism and strategy guiding all aspects of development; however, numerous setbacks stymied the game's development and forced the developers to crunch. Though his name is in the game's title, Tom Clancy's involvement in Rainbow Six's development was very minimal. Red Storm developed the PC version, while all other ports were developed by their respective companies.\nRainbow Six was released on August 21, 1998 to widespread critical acclaim, though the console ports received relatively lower ratings than the PC version. For most releases, praise was directed toward gameplay, multiplayer, immersion, and the game's combination of strategy and action, while criticism mainly centered on AI issues, glitches, and the graphics and controls of some ports. The game sold over 200,000 copies in its first year of release and continued to sell hundreds of thousands more copies well into the early 2000s. Rainbow Six was nominated for numerous accolades and has been deemed one of the best video games of 1998. It is considered a milestone in the history of first-person shooters and made a lasting impact on the then-fledgling tactical shooter genre.\nAn expansion pack, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mission Pack: Eagle Watch, was released on January 26, 1999. A sequel, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear, was released in 1999. A loose mobile game remake, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Shadow Vanguard, was released in 2011.\n\n",

One explanation states that the tradition derived from the Pagans who thought that trees were the homes of fairies, spirits, dryads and many other mystical creatures. The custom might also be related to Christian religious pieces such as wooden crucifixes. It might also come from the game of tag, where some define a rule called \"Tiggy Touchwood\" so that players are safe from being tagged if they are touching wood."

Skywalker is secretly lured into the Sith warrior cult by the Galactic Republic politician Palpatine. When Palpatine seizes control of the galaxy as its Emperor, Skywalker betrays the Jedi Order and, during a duel with Kenobi, is severely mutilated and thereafter transformed into a cyborg whom Palpatine rebrands as the Sith lord Darth Vader. He serves the Emperor for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance who oppose the new Empire. Finally, when Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son Luke, the Sith lord turns against his master, leading to the mutual destruction of Palpatine and Vader, which effectively brings the Empire to its end.\nIn secret, Vader is the husband of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the father of Luke Skywalker and his twin sister Leia Organa, and the grandfather of Ben Solo (later known as Kylo Ren).\nDavid Prowse physically portrayed Vader in the original trilogy, while James Earl Jones provided his voice in all of the films and some other appearances, which continues to be used as a vocal template following Jones's retirement and death. Sebastian Shaw portrayed Anakin unmasked and as a ghost in Return of the Jedi (1983), while Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portrayed Anakin in the prequel trilogy, with Christensen reprising the role in the series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Ahsoka (2023). In the standalone film Rogue One (2016), Vader is portrayed by Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous. The character also appears in novels, comics, and video games."

            "Deepwater Horizon oil spill response | The Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred between 10 April and 19 September 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. A variety of techniques were used to address fundamental strategies for addressing the spilled oil, which were: to contain oil on the surface, dispersal, and removal. While most of the oil drilled off Louisiana is a lighter crude, the leaking oil was of a heavier blend which contained asphalt-like substances. According to Ed Overton, who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills, this type of oil emulsifies well. Once it becomes emulsified, it no longer evaporates as quickly as regular oil, does not rinse off as easily, cannot be broken down by microbes as easily, and does not burn as well. \"That type of mixture essentially removes all the best oil clean-up weapons\", Overton said.\nOn 6 May 2010, BP began documenting the daily response efforts on its web site. On 28 April, the US military joined the cleanup operation. The response increased in scale as the spill volume grew. Initially, BP employed remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV's), 700 workers, 4 airplanes, and 32 vessels. By 29 April 69 vessels, including skimmers, tugs, barges, and recovery vessels, were in use. By 4 May 2010, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) estimated that 170 vessels, and nearly 7,500 personnel were participating, with an additional 2,000 volunteers assisting. These volunteers help build relief walls, burn the oil, clean the water and other effected bodies of water such as marshes, beaches, and shorelines, clean contaminated equipment and vessels, and were involved in both land and water response outreach.\nIn summer 2010, approximately 47,000 people and 7,000 vessels were involved in the response works. By 3 October 2012, federal response costs amounted $850 million, most of them reimbursed by BP. As of January 2013, 935 response personnel were still involved in response activities in the region. For that time BP's costs for cleanup operations exceeded $14 billion. The oil drill was finally sealed on 15 July 2010.\n\n",
            "Deepwater Horizon litigation | The civil and criminal proceedings stemming from the explosion of Deepwater Horizon and the resulting massive oil spill in the  Gulf of Mexico began shortly after the April 20, 2010 incident and have continued since then. They have included an extensive claims settlement process for a guilty plea to criminal charges by BP, and an ongoing Clean Water Act lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and other parties.\n\nA federal judge, ruling on the Clean Water Act suit in September 2014, found that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill as a result of its deliberate misconduct and gross negligence. The finding means that the company may be subject to $18 billion in penalties in addition to the $28 billion already paid out in claims and cleanup costs. Such penalties are far larger than the $3.5 billion BP had allotted to the case, and could have grave implications for the company.",
            "BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics, and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the United States government. BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $4. 525 billion in fines and other payments. As of 2018, cleanup costs, charges and penalties had cost the company more than $65 billion. In September 2014, a United States District Court judge ruled that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill because of its gross negligence and reckless conduct. In April 2016, BP agreed to pay $20. 8 billion in fines, the largest environmental damage settlement in United States history."

            "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky | Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (  chy-KOF-skee; 7 May 1840 \u2013 6 November 1893) was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally. Tchaikovsky wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the classical repertoire, including the ballets Swan Lake and The Nutcracker, the 1812 Overture, his First Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto, the Romeo and Juliet Overture-Fantasy, several symphonies, and the opera Eugene Onegin. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant as there was little opportunity for a musical career in Russia at the time and no public music education system. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching Tchaikovsky received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From that reconciliation, he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style. The principles that governed melody, harmony, and other fundamentals of Russian music diverged from those that governed Western European music. There seemed to be little potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and this caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. That resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity, an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career. Despite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by her early death, the death of his close friend and colleague Nikolai Rubinstein, his failed marriage to Antonina Miliukova, and the collapse of his 13-year association with the wealthy patroness Nadezhda von Meck. Tchaikovsky's homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some scholars have downplayed its importance. His dedication of his Sixth symphony to his nephew Vladimir Davydov and the feelings he expressed about Davydov in letters to others have been cited as evidence for romantic love between the two. Tchaikovsky's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera, but there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the cause and whether the death was intentional. While his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it sufficiently represented native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements."

            "Harley Quinn | Harley Quinn (Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, PhD) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. She was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for Batman: The Animated Series as a henchwoman for the Joker, and debuted in its 22nd episode, \"Joker's Favor\", on September 11, 1992. While intended to appear in one episode, Quinn became a recurring character within the DC Animated Universe (DCAU) as the Joker's sidekick and love interest, and was adapted into DC Comics' canon seven years later, beginning with the one-shot Batman: Harley Quinn #1 (October 1999). Quinn's origin story features her as a former psychologist at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum who was manipulated by and fell in love with the Joker, her patient, eventually becoming his accomplice and lover. The character's alias is a play on the stock character Harlequin from the 16th-century Italian theater commedia dell'arte. Following her introduction to the comics in 1999, Harley Quinn was depicted as the former doctor turned sidekick and lover of the Joker as well as the criminal associate and best friend of Poison Ivy. Later stories depicted Quinn as an independent supervillain who has left her codependent relationship with the Joker behind, beginning with the publication of her ongoing series, Harley Quinn. After years of scarce appearances in comics, Quinn returned in a leading role in 2009 with the Gotham City Sirens series, as part of an unstable alliance with Poison Ivy and Catwoman. The character's design was modernised in 2011 for DC's \"The New 52\" line-wide relaunch, with the character since regularly featuring as an antihero in the Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey team books. Other changes included fronting her own light-hearted Harley Quinn comic book and being established in a new romantic relationship with Poison Ivy. In 2021, DC's line-wide Infinite Frontier relaunch brought Quinn back to Gotham City and reestablished her as a superhero seeking redemption for her past actions, and now she currently acts as an antihero. Harley Quinn's abilities include expert gymnastic skills, proficiency in weapons and hand-to-hand combat, complete unpredictability, immunity to toxins, and enhanced strength, agility, and durability. Quinn often wields clown-themed gag weapons, with an oversized mallet being her signature weapon. Additionally, she has a pair of pet hyenas, Bud and Lou, who sometimes serve as her attack dogs. Harley Quinn has become one of DC Comics' most popular and profitable characters. She has been featured in many of DC's comic books and adapted in various other media and merchandise. DC Comics Publisher Jim Lee considers Harley Quinn the fourth pillar of DC Comics' publishing line, behind Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Originally voiced by Arleen Sorkin in the DC Animated Universe, she has since appeared in many other DC projects voiced by actresses such as Tara Strong, Hynden Walch, Laura Bailey, Jenny Slate, Melissa Rauch, Laura Post, and Kaley Cuoco. Cuoco provided the character's voice in the 2019 animated series Harley Quinn."

            "Reform Party of Canada | The Reform Party of Canada (French: Parti r\u00e9formiste du Canada) was a right-wing populist and conservative federal political party in Canada that existed from 1987 to 2000. Reform was founded as a Western Canada-based protest movement that eventually became a populist conservative party, with strong social conservative and fiscal conservative elements. It was initially motivated by profound Western Canadian discontent with the Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) government of Brian Mulroney.\nLed by its founder Preston Manning throughout its existence, Reform was considered a populist movement that rapidly gained popularity and momentum in Western Canada during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to attracting social conservatives, the party was popular among Western Canadians who were disillusioned with Mulroney's perceived prioritization of Quebec (during his attempts to reform the Constitution) as well as fiscal conservatives who were critical of the Mulroney government's tax increases and inability to reduce the budget deficit. In a 1989 by-election, Reform won its first-ever seat in the House of Commons before making a major electoral breakthrough in the 1993 federal election, when it supplanted the PCs as the largest conservative party in Canada. In opposition, the party advocated for spending restraint, tax cuts, reductions in immigration, and wider reform of Canada's political institutions such as the Senate. In the 1997 federal election, the party attempted to make a national breakthrough by running candidates in all provinces and territories. Although they became the Official Opposition, a Liberal majority and disappointment with the lack of Eastern seats led many members to question the future direction of the party.\nIn an attempt to move beyond its Western Canadian regional base and broaden its platform to encompass ideas from Eastern Canada, the party changed its name to the Canadian Alliance in 2000. That same year, the Alliance lost an election to a third Liberal majority. In 2003, the Unite the Right movement culminated in the Alliance merging with the Progressive Conservative Party to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada. Reform's impact on the Conservative Party's leaders and policies has been significant; three of its four permanent leaders were once Reform Party members.",
            "Timeline of modern American conservatism | This timeline of modern American conservatism lists important events, developments and occurrences that have affected conservatism in the United States. With the decline of the conservative wing of the Democratic Party following 1960, the movement is most closely associated with the Republican Party (GOP). Economic conservatives favor less government regulation, lower taxes and weaker labor unions while social conservatives focus on moral issues and neoconservatives focus on democracy worldwide. Some conservatives generally distrust the United Nations and Europe and, apart from the libertarian wing, favor a strong military.\nAlthough conservatism has much older roots in American history, the modern movement began to solidify in the mid-1930s when intellectuals and politicians collaborated with businessmen to oppose the liberalism of the New Deal led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, newly energized labor unions and big-city Democratic machines. After World War II, that coalition gained strength from new philosophers and writers who developed an intellectual rationale for conservatism.\nRichard Nixon's victory in the 1968 election is often considered a realigning election in American politics. From 1932 to 1968, the Democratic Party was the majority party as during that time the Democrats had won seven out of nine presidential elections and their agenda gravely affected that undertaken by  Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, which was altered completely with Nixon's 1968 electoral victory. Democrats were largely split over whether to support or oppose the Vietnam War, and many whites felt the national Democratic Party had deserted them, leading many of them to vote Republican at the presidential level since the 1950s and at the state and local level since the 1990s.\nIn the 1980 presidential election and in his subsequent presidential administration, Ronald Reagan rejuvenated conservatism in the United States, supporting tax cuts, significantly increasing defense spending, deregulation, and breaking with the post-World War II foreign policy consensus of containing the Soviet Union and instead introducing and advancing the Reagan Doctrine, which sought to rollback global communism and bring an end to the Cold War.\nReagan also supported and advanced the ideals associated with family values and a \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d morality, leading many historians to call the 1980s the Reagan era. In the 21st century, issues such as abortion, gun control, euthanasia, assisted suicide, LGBTQ rights, and foreign policy have grown in importance to many American conservatives. Since 2009, the Tea Party movement has energized conservatives at the local level against the policies made by the presidency of Barack Obama, leading to Republican success in the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections, and the 2016 election, in which Donald Trump was elected president.\n\n",
            "Fiscal conservatism | In American political theory, fiscal conservatism or economic conservatism is a political and economic philosophy regarding fiscal policy and fiscal responsibility with an ideological basis in capitalism, individualism, limited government, and laissez-faire economics. Fiscal conservatives advocate tax cuts, reduced government spending, free markets, deregulation, privatization, free trade, and minimal government debt. Fiscal conservatism follows the same philosophical outlook as classical liberalism. This concept is derived from economic liberalism and later neoliberalism.\nThe term has its origins in the era of the American New Deal during the 1930s as a result of the policies initiated by modern liberals, when many classical liberals started calling themselves conservatives as they did not wish to be identified with what was being called liberalism in the United States. In the United States, the term liberalism has become associated with the welfare state and expanded regulatory policies created as a result of the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards.\nFiscal conservatives formed one of the three legs of the traditional American conservative movement that had emerged during the 1950s, together with social conservatism and national defense conservatism.  Many Americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as libertarian, holding more cultural liberal views and advocating a non-interventionist foreign policy while supporting lower taxes and less government spending. As of 2020, 39% of Americans polled considered themselves \"economically conservative\".\nBecause of its proximity to the United States, the term has entered the lexicon in Canada. In many other countries, economic liberalism or simply liberalism is used to describe what Americans call fiscal conservatism.",
            "Political history of the United Kingdom (1979\u2013present) | The modern political history of the United Kingdom (1979\u2013present) began when Margaret Thatcher gained power in 1979, giving rise to 18 years of Conservative government. Victory in the Falklands War (1982) and the government's strong opposition to trade unions helped lead the Conservative Party to another three terms in government. Thatcher initially pursued monetarist policies and went on to privatise many of Britain's nationalised companies such as British Telecom, British Gas Corporation, British Airways and British Steel Corporation. She kept the National Health Service. The controversial \"poll tax\" to fund local government was unpopular, and the Conservatives removed Thatcher as prime minister in 1990, although Michael Heseltine, the minister who did much to undermine her, did not personally benefit from her being ousted. Thatcher's successor, John Major, replaced the \"poll tax\" with Council Tax and oversaw successful British involvement in the Gulf War. Despite a recession, Major led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in 1992. The events of Black Wednesday in 1992, party disunity over the European Union and several scandals involving Conservative politicians all led to the Labour Party winning a landslide election victory under Tony Blair in 1997. Labour had shifted its policies from the political left closer to the centre, under the slogan of 'New Labour'. The Bank of England was given independence over monetary policy and Scotland and Wales were given a devolved Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly respectively, whilst London wide local government was also re-established in the form of an Assembly and Mayor. The Good Friday Agreement was negotiated in 1997 in an effort to end The Troubles in Northern Ireland, with a devolved, power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly being established in 1998. Blair led Britain into the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars before leaving office in 2007, when he was succeeded by his chancellor, Gordon Brown. The 2008 financial crisis led to Labour's defeat in the 2010 election. It was replaced by a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, headed by David Cameron, that pursued a series of public spending cuts with the intention of reducing the budget deficit. In 2016, the UK voted in an advisory referendum to leave the European Union, which led to Cameron's resignation. Cameron was succeeded by his home secretary, Theresa May. May engaged in a policy to take the country out of the European Union through her flagship Brexit withdrawal agreement. When this deal failed to pass through the House of Commons three times, May resigned. The subsequent Conservative leadership election was won by former Foreign Secretary and Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who became prime minister in July 2019. A Conservative landslide victory in the general election five months later allowed for a majority government and the UK's withdrawal from the EU in January 2020. Amid numerous scandals and a government crisis, Johnson resigned in September 2022 and was succeeded by his Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.",

Officially designated 1P/Halley, it is also commonly called Comet Halley, or sometimes simply Halley. \nHalley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC, but it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet. As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Halley.\nIn March 1986, during its latest visit to the inner Solar System, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by a spacecraft, ESA's Giotto mission, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation.

In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U. S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. Freshman Greg Oden from Ohio State University was drafted first overall by the Portland Trail Blazers, who won the draft lottery. However, he missed the 2007\u201308 season due to microfracture surgery on his right knee during the pre-season. Another freshman, Kevin Durant, was drafted second overall from the University of Texas by the Seattle SuperSonics, and went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award for the 2007\u201308 season. Oden and Durant became the first freshmen to be selected with the top two picks in the draft. Al Horford, the son of former NBA player Tito Horford, was drafted third by the Atlanta Hawks. Of the three top picks, Durant has been a League MVP, a two-time finals MVP and perennial All-Star while Horford has enjoyed a solid All-Star career. Oden, however, was beset by numerous microfracture surgeries on both knees that limited him to only 82 games from 2008 to 2010. On the night after the draft, the Seattle Supersonics traded seven-time All-Star Ray Allen along with the draft rights of the 35th pick Glen Davis to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Delonte West, Wally Szczerbiak, and the draft rights to the 5th pick, Jeff Green. The Portland Trail Blazers and the New York Knicks were also involved in a multi-player trade that sent Zach Randolph to the Knicks and Steve Francis to the Blazers. Apart from those two trades, nine further draft-day trades were announced. The 2007 draft marked the first time three players drafted in the top 10 came from the same school: the University of Florida. Florida, the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Basketball champion, tied the record set by the University of Connecticut in 2006 with five players selected in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. Florida joined nine other schools, including Connecticut, that had five players selected in an NBA draft, second only to UNLV, which had six players selected in the eight-round 1977 draft. Five players who competed in the 2007 NCAA Basketball National Championship Final were selected in the top 10; three players came from Florida, and two players came from the runner-up, Ohio State University. This draft also set the record number of freshmen drafted in the first round when eight freshmen were selected. Of the 60 players drafted, eight were freshmen, five were sophomores, 14 were juniors, 20 were seniors, and 13 were international players without U. S. college basketball experience. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors all did not have a draft pick this year, although Indiana and Toronto each acquired a drafted player's rights after the draft.",

            "Kevin Durant | Kevin Wayne Durant (born September 29, 1988), also known by his initials KD, is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Durant has won two NBA championships, four Olympic gold medals, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He has been named to 11 All-NBA teams (including six First Teams) and selected 15 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. He ranks eighth among NBA career scoring leaders.\nDurant was heavily recruited in high school, widely regarded as the second-best player his senior year. He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, during which he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. Durant was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise (which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008), leading them to a Finals appearance in 2012 and winning the MVP award for the 2013\u20132014 season. He later signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, who won a record 73 regular season games the previous year. Durant won consecutive NBA championships and Finals MVPs in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 NBA Finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Phoenix Suns the following year. After two full seasons with Phoenix, Durant was traded to the Houston Rockets in July 2025.\nAs a member of the U.S. national team, Durant has won four gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024), and is the leading scorer in Team USA's Olympic basketball history. In 2024, he became the first male athlete to win four Olympics gold medals in a team sport. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Durant is the only player in basketball history with MVPs in the NBA, Olympics and World Cup.\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In 2018, Durant was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer."

It was broadcast  on television in 115 countries. In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U. S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. Freshman Greg Oden from Ohio State University was drafted first overall by the Portland Trail Blazers, who won the draft lottery. However, he missed the 2007\u201308 season due to microfracture surgery on his right knee during the pre-season. Another freshman, Kevin Durant, was drafted second overall from the University of Texas by the Seattle SuperSonics, and went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award for the 2007\u201308 season. Oden and Durant became the first freshmen to be selected with the top two picks in the draft. Al Horford, the son of former NBA player Tito Horford, was drafted third by the Atlanta Hawks. Of the three top picks, Durant has been a League MVP, a two-time finals MVP and perennial All-Star while Horford has enjoyed a solid All-Star career. Oden, however, was beset by numerous microfracture surgeries on both knees that limited him to only 82 games from 2008 to 2010. On the night after the draft, the Seattle Supersonics traded seven-time All-Star Ray Allen along with the draft rights of the 35th pick Glen Davis to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Delonte West, Wally Szczerbiak, and the draft rights to the 5th pick, Jeff Green. The Portland Trail Blazers and the New York Knicks were also involved in a multi-player trade that sent Zach Randolph to the Knicks and Steve Francis to the Blazers. Apart from those two trades, nine further draft-day trades were announced. The 2007 draft marked the first time three players drafted in the top 10 came from the same school: the University of Florida. Florida, the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Basketball champion, tied the record set by the University of Connecticut in 2006 with five players selected in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. Florida joined nine other schools, including Connecticut, that had five players selected in an NBA draft, second only to UNLV, which had six players selected in the eight-round 1977 draft. Five players who competed in the 2007 NCAA Basketball National Championship Final were selected in the top 10; three players came from Florida, and two players came from the runner-up, Ohio State University. This draft also set the record number of freshmen drafted in the first round when eight freshmen were selected. Of the 60 players drafted, eight were freshmen, five were sophomores, 14 were juniors, 20 were seniors, and 13 were international players without U. S. college basketball experience. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors all did not have a draft pick this year, although Indiana and Toronto each acquired a drafted player's rights after the draft.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00ab{'snippet': 'On May 22, 2007, the SuperSonics were awarded the second pick in the 2007 NBA draft , equaling the highest draft position the team ever held, selecting Kevin Durant from the University of Texas.', 'title': 'Seattle SuperSonics - Wikipedia', 'link': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics'}\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abKevin Durant , 1988), also known by his initials KD, is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Durant has won two NBA championships, four Olympic gold medals, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He has been named to 11 All-NBA teams (including six First Teams) and selected 15 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. He ranks eighth among NBA career scoring leaders.\\nDurant was heavily recruited in high school, widely regarded as the second-best player his senior year. He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, during which he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. Durant was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise (which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008), leading them to a Finals appearance in 2012 and winning the MVP award for the 2013\u20132014 season. He later signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, who won a record 73 regular season games the previous year. Durant won consecutive NBA championships and Finals MVPs in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 NBA Finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Phoenix Suns the following year. After two full seasons with Phoenix, Durant was traded to the Houston Rockets in July 2025.\\nAs a member of the U.S. national team, Durant has won four gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024), and is the leading scorer in Team USA's Olympic basketball history. In 2024, he became the first male athlete to win four Olympics gold medals in a team sport. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Durant is the only player in basketball history with MVPs in the NBA, Olympics and World Cup.\\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In 2018, Durant was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer.\u00bb\",\n  \"Question\": \"Where did kevin durant go in the nba draft?\",\n  \"Disambiguations\": \"DQ 1: What team drafted Kevin Durant in the NBA draft? \\nDA 1: Seattle SuperSonics\\nDQ 2: What draft pick number was Kevin Durant? \\nDA 2: Second overall\\nDQ 3: What overall draft pick number was Kevin Durant?\\nDA 3: Second\\nDQ 4: What team drafted Kevin Durant in the 2007 NBA draft?\\nDA 4: Seattle SuperSonics\\nDQ 5: What draft pick number was Kevin Durant in the 2007 NBA draft?\\nDA 5: 2nd\\nDQ 6: What overall draft pick number was Kevin Durant in the 2007 NBA draft?\\nDA 6: Second\\nDQ 7: What draft pick number was Kevin Durant in his round of the 2007 NBA draft?\\nDA 7: Second\",\n  \"Answer\": \"Kevin Durant was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft.

Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Court's unanimous (9\u20130) decision stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\", and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution."

                    "The USS Maine was a United States Navy ship that sank in Havana Harbor in February 1898, contributing to the outbreak of the Spanish\u2013American War. American newspapers, engaging in yellow journalism to boost circulation, claimed that Spain was responsible for the ship's explosion and destruction. To determine the cause of the explosion and destruction of the Maine, Spain launched a formal investigation in 1898. Two United States Naval Courts of Inquiry have also been ordered to determine the cause, The Sampson Board in 1898 and the Vreeland board in 1911. In 1976, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion, and the National Geographic Society did an investigation in 1999 using computer simulations. All of these investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship, but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded. The Sampson Board of Inquiry blamed an external explosion from a mine. However, in the most recent investigation to determine the cause of the explosion of the Maine, the Discovery Channel used photographic evidence, naval experts, and archival information to argue that the cause of the explosion was a coal bunker fire, and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the former to the latter."
